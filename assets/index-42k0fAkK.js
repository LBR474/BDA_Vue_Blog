I like watching bike racing on TV</h2><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+ea+'" alt=""><figcaption>Milan San Remo bike race.</figcaption></figure> A few months ago I was talking on the phone with my friend Michael, and I said: <i> ‘it’s a strange phase of life for me at the moment Michael, the only thing I really like to do is ride my own bike for 50 kilometres, then come home and watch other people ride their bikes for 200 kilometres’.</i> <br> Which made me think about why I like it so much. <br> I’ve written about this before, in the previous blog incarnation, but I’ll just mention it again as background. <br> In about the mid-noughties - which I think is the main nickname for the period from 2000-2009 - I began to descend unhappily, and frighteningly quickly into full-blown alcoholism. I always vaguely knew I had some depressive tendencies, but when that began to happen, I feel - looking back on it - that I had no idea just how depressed I had become. <br> If I had some work to do, I would go and do it, and if I could summon the energy after that, I would go surfing. <br> However on days with no work, I would often look out the window and try to find a reason to get through the day, often I couldn’t really find a reason to go out the front door, and so sadly my I-can-start-drinking time began to drift inexorably forwards. <br> When things got bad, I might start drinking at 11 o’clock in the morning, just under the heading of having nothing else to do. <br> This of course began to radically affect my sleeping patterns, and it is an easy step of logic to see that if you’re going to start imbibing at 11a.m, then by three or four pm you’re going to crash down into a restless, non-refreshing “sleep”. Then I would wake up perhaps at 9pm and be wide awake and unable to sleep at the customary hours humans sleep.<br> So I would turn on the TV and, ever so thankfully, as I recall, when this began to happen regularly, it was mid-winter, and so the Tour de France was on TV and so I began watching that as I waited for some form of sleepiness to return.<br> And immediately I fell in love with it, and gained a great deal of meditative pleasure from watching the kilometres disappear under the wheels of the cyclists, a pleasure which is still with me today.<br> Now, fifteen or so years later it occurred to me to wonder what it is about bike racing on TV that I continue to like so much, and write this post about it.<br> So first, and I think most obviously, there is the scenery.<br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+ta+'" alt=""></figure> Most sports that have large audiences are played in a single location, e.g. aussie rules, rugby league and cricket.<br> For those sports you hardly notice the stadium, your attention is focussed solely on the game.<br> However with bike racing, you follow the race through the country for 150-200 kilometres, seeing the beautiful scenery along the way as a supremely pleasant background to watching the race.<br> With stage racing, I should add, most stages are 150-200 kilometres long, and there is a general, informal, structure of the racing along the stage.<br> That is, at the beginning of the stage, a smaller group of riders rush frantically forwards and form a breakaway.<br> This smaller group then race onwards, two or three minutes ahead of the main group, the peloton, for the next hundred or so kilometres.<br> Most road racing is done at around 40 kph, and so for the first two and a half hours of the race on that day, things are pretty calm, all right, can be described as boring, as we watch the race mosey along with no positional changes from the riders.<br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+oa+'" alt=""></figure> So this calm period is actually something I like, I find it an aid to meditation, and the network covering the race know this as well, so they do their research and have lots of information about the various spots of interest the race passes along the way to bring up onto the bottom of the screen for the audience to read and learn about the countryside, history and culture of the country we are currently racing through.<br> So I think what I’m saying there is that even if you have no interest in bike racing, then you can watch the bike racing and just get enjoyment from the picturesque nature of the coverage.<br> Which leads to another point, John Muir was an american pioneer wilderness preservationist who was one of the founders of the Appalacian Trail hiking route down the eastern seaboard of the United States, and he famously <a href="https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/theres-the-back-fence-line-again/"> said</a> of the beauty of this wilderness that upon seeing it: <br> <i> ‘Who has not felt the urge to throw a loaf of bread and a pound of tea in an old sack and jump over the back fence?’ </i> <br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+na+'" alt=""><figcaption>The Appalachian wilderness</figcaption><img src="'+ra+'" alt=""><figcaption>The Appalachian trail</figcaption></figure> To which I would add, who can look the photos above of the Milan-San Remo bike race, and not want to immediately head down the tourist office and book a flight and go and see Italy? <br><br><br><h2>Now on to the complaining</h2> So bike racing is a thing I enjoy, but sadly that now leads us to the part you’ve all been dreading, which is the complaining part.<br> Before bike racing came into my life, my previous great enjoyment was watching test cricket on TV.<br> Test cricket has a slow rhythm and goes for six hours of the day and I found something relaxing in the slow paced tempo of this sport.<br> I’d lost a lot of interest in cricket for a while, but then about 2001 I got dumped, badly, by a woman who I had fallen deeply in love with.<br> With my life an empty, gray, barren plane of despair, and not drinking at the time as I’d finally realised that I had a problem, I found each day stretching before me like a prison sentence.<br> I hung around my home, smoking innumerable cigarettes - I hadn’t figured that one yet - and tried to pass my time.<br> One day I turned on the TV to see if anything there could occupy my mind, and discovered the cricket was on.<br> So I sat down to watch it.<br> It was a godsend in its way, I became immediately absorbed in the match, even more than I had been as a young child.<br> It wasn’t so much that I was interested in the outcome, it wasn’t something to do, it was more an absence of nothing.<br> While the cricket was on, and with the drone of Ian Chappell and the rest of the Channel Nine commentary team I could shut out the pain of my recent dumping.<br> There then began a new love affair with cricket that went on for the next ten to 15 years.<br> That love deepened when I realised you could listen to the ABC commentary with Jim Maxwell and the team in sync with the TV with the sound off, and thus the very quickly annoying Channel Nine commentary team turned down to zero volume.<br> However things began to change markedly in the modern era when Cricket Australia turned into a money hungry organisation, with no concern for test cricket fans, only how much money they could ring out of the wallets of anyone with a remote interest in the white-flannelled game.<br> So Cricket Australia began to sell the game we loved to the highest bidder, and allow the most appallingly destructive advertising to rule the sport.<br> Additionally, they worked out that there were a number of people like me who watched the game in silence and listened to the ABC - commercial free - commentary, and realised that meant we weren’t hearing the ads, and so changed the technicalities of the broadcast so that it was no longer possible to sync the ABC coverage with the TV.<br> And the worst of this advertising in my opinion is alcohol advertising.<br> There are sposed to be rules to stop the advertising of alcohol to children, but the advertising industry just ran roughshod over any sense of morality and had the rule changed so they could advertise alcohol to those underage.<br> So I tried to watch the test cricket with the ABC commentary but in the end, sooner or later an alcohol ad appeared, and this made me so angry that I just couldn’t enjoy the match, furious at this outrageous display of immorality from the advertising industry, Cricket Australia and the host broadcaster, then Channel Nine, now Channel Seven.<br> Since watching test cricket was supposed to be part of my therapy, and in fact it was only making me more angry, test cricket just had to go from my watching rotation.<br> Further to that, while advertising alcohol to children is just flat out wrong, I would go further and state that Australia needs no alcohol advertising at all.<br> As ever with these diatribes, I’m never calling for the banning of alcohol, as of prohibition in the US in the twenties, I am simply saying that anyone who wants a drink can have one, and knows where to get one, so why do we need any ads encouraging people to have a drink at 9.30 on Saturday morning when the test cricket broadcast begins? Answer: we don’t.<br> But as ever while I’m working to bring my blood pressure down to safe levels, as they are always inordinately exercised whenever I think about this outrageously amoral alcohol advertising, I’m reminded of where the counter to this was done best, on the D-Generation in the 80s.<br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ia+'" alt=""><figcaption>The D-Generation, one of the greatest shows ever produced in Australia</figcaption></figure> At that time the advertising industry brought out an ad, too fatuous for words, in which they tried to make people love advertising.<br> The theme of the ad was: <i> ‘in some countries they don’t have advertising to annoy them’.</i><br> It showed a family sitting around in their living room, surrounded by consumer durables, and one by one each item - couch, TV, fridge, etc - were removed from the family, and each time the stentorian voice over would say: <i> ‘in some countries they don’t have advertising to annoy them’. </i><br> Meaning, that without advertising you would not have any of the household items you hold dear. <br> Even as I think back to that utterly ridiculous ad, I find it impossible to believe that even the people who wrote that ad could possibly think that anyone would believe it, most notably the advertising industry trying to claim that the reason why there was a couch in your house was because you saw an ad on TV for couches, and were suddenly struck with the blindingly brilliant idea that instead of wallowing around on the floor, you should go out and buy something for your family to sit on.<br> This ad was just too moronic and enraging for words, however the D-Generation soon showed the utter idiocy and stupidity of that ad, they ran a spoof ad which followed the same pattern, of the family having their durables removed with the <i> ‘some countries don’t have advertising to annoy them’</i> voice over, but on the last one the D-Generation added: <b><i>‘we do’.</i></b><br><div style="clear:both;"></div></article><p><h2>Quirky corner</h2><article><h3>Long distance service</h3><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+sa+'" alt=""></figure><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+aa+'" alt=""></figure> I pulled up short outside one of my local supermarkets, astounded at the service implied here. <br> I&#39;m not sure how this would work, but any commercial enterprise that offers to stay open for the full five and a half thousand kilometres, sure gets my vote!

After a few minutes of discussion Geoff, the instructor, called it to a halt and said, not in so many words: &#39;<i> you&#39;re all wrong, the answer is soil loss</i>&#39;. <br> He then proceeded to explain that, and it did make immediate sense. <br> His argument, and I came to fully agree, was that (This is if I recall properly) that although pollution, high extinction rates, climate change and all the rest were, and are, very bad things, they can all be worked on and solved with some effort. <br> Climate change can be immediately solved by closing coal mines and gas fields and moving with great energy to bring in more renewable energy and continuing the research to make all forms of renewable energy even more efficient. <br> However, soil loss is a problem that no amount of human effort can solve. <br> This is of course due to the phenomenally long time that it takes for the earth&#39;s geological processes to make soil in the first place. <br> When I was researching this I quickly had a check in case against all odds somehow, somewhere, some group had found a way to make soil, but of course that hasn’t happened. <br> There are various links that come up when you type ‘<i>Can humans make soil?</i>’ into your favourite search engine, but these all refer to not making soil, increasing the sum total of tonnes of soil on the Earth, but refer instead to getting various mixes of different types of soil that already exist, and blending them in different proportions to provide soils that do different things that humans want - soil specially for growing seeds, raising or lowering the pH etc. <br> One of my favourite authors, Kim Stanley Robinson went into this in some depth in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy"> Mars trilogy. </a><br> As Kim describes there, and it applies to Earth as well as Mars, or indeed any planet where humans plan to go in the future. <br> Soil can only really be made by geological processes. <br> In the Mars trilogy, the human engineers, agronomists and ecologists set up a research project where they see if they can make soil. <br> They create a huge installation with many giant steel incubating vats and they put various amounts of the poor martian soil, with microbes brought from Earth, plus organic matter and nematodes and suchlike crawling creatures and let it percolate away to see if it can produce useful soil. <br> However while it all works to a certain degree, the process is so slow, that it becomes a rather futile exercise. <br> Kim notes that given the results from all their huge steel vats at the engineering centre, the best they could hope for is to produce 1 centimetre of soil to cover the whole land area of Mars, and that would take a century to produce. <br> And please note, although Kim Stanley Robinson is a science fiction writer, I feel he is more than that, I prefer to call him an extrapolationist, someone who sees where we’re at now, and works methodically forwards to where he feels we will be at at certain future periods of history. <br> Thus I feel his scientific predictions are more than just stories, but good indicators of likely future outcomes. <br> So back here on Earth, all of that still applies to us, we can’t make soil, or we can’t make soil in a fashion that is of a speed that would be of any earthly (literally and metaphorically) any use to us. <br> The most fertile soil on Earth is generally thought to be volcanic soils (it’s the youngest, so stills contains its full complement of minerals and trace elements) and a workaround solution - you may suggest - is to get some volcanic rock, basalt say, and pulverise that into a fine powder, and then you have made some soil, which you could put in a bag, and sell to someone gardening on less than quality soil. <br> However, you can immediately see that the amount of energy you would need to smash the single concise rock into a powder is so massive, and would take so long, that once again we are behind the energy equation, and the “making” of soil in this way is a futile exercise. <br> And that ties the whole thing up fairly neatly to the original point, which is that bare soil is death, soil loss is a big problem, perhaps the biggest that humans face in the 21st century. <br> So whether you have a window box on the window sill of your kitchen containing three herb plants, or you&#39;re a broad acre farmer with 5,000 hectares in a rural area, cover your soil! <br> Not only does this reduce soil loss via runoff into the waterways, it provides you with immediate benefits of stopping evaporation, and protecting your plant roots from harsh baking summer sun and freezing, biting winter frosts. <br><p></p><h3>2) If in doubt, do nothing/One hour’s observation is worth ten hours work.</h3> <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+fa+'" alt=""><figcaption>Tradescantia fluminens</figcaption></figure> These two rules go well together, and are a pair of rules that most people latch onto with immediate glee, as it seems to be an excuse to do nothing in the garden, at least in the beginning. <br> Excuse or not, they are still valuable weapons in your armoury. <br> The example my permaculture teacher gave was to do with weeds. <br> People would work successfully in the city for many years in a high-paying job, and with the money piling up, they would then buy an acreage property outside Byron Bay. <br> Contracts would be exchanged, and finally the day would come when they could drive or fly up, and spend their first vacation on the land they had recently bought. <br> Almost as soon as there they would notice how overgrown with weeds the area had become, and they’d check the local department of agriculture website and learn that almost all the chest-high green growth they could see was “weeds” so they would go out and starting with the garden beds around the house, begin pulling the weeds out of the ground. <br> However this is almost immediately counter-productive, as for one thing, it just exposes the soil and takes us almost immediately back to rule 1) bare soil is death. <br> A far better way to tackle the weed “problem” on your land, is to spend the first holiday up there just observing what is happening on your land, and making some minor notes. <br> One of the observations that is probably first and foremost is what type of weeds are growing where. Tradescantia, for instance, grows best in shaded, mostly moist areas. <br> [NB: tradescantia has a common name that is quite racially derogatory, so I won’t use it, but will just provide a picture of this plant instead] <br> So observe where the tradescantia is growing, and resolve to plant something in that area that has a similar growth habit. <br> As I recall, basil and tomatoes grow well together, and like the same sort of ground that the tradescantia is growing on. <br> So instead of pulling the trad out of the ground on your first holiday, leave it there, go down to your local organic nursery, buy some good quality tomatoes and basil, then come home, clear a small amount of trad away and plant your basil and tomatoes in the small clearing you have created. <br> Farmer’s friends are another one. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ga+'" alt=""><figcaption>Farmers friends</figcaption></figure> Why this weed is called Farmer’s Friends is a matter for some debate, still. <br> One opinion is that the burrs of the Farmer’s Friends are so numerous and stick to your clothing so relentlessly, that a farmer walking in an overgrown field quickly becomes covered in the prickles and it looks like the farmer has lots of friends clinging to them. <br> However what I’ve found is that this weed is ultimately a brilliant aid to the home gardener. When you pull it out of the ground, and it comes out very easily, it leaves a small hole perfect for you to plant in, so, like the tradescantia above, don’t just pull the plant out of the ground the moment you see it, but instead note where they are growing, find a plant that looks similar, then when you’re ready to plant, pull the Farmer’s Friend out of the ground, and with no digging, even with a hand trowel, you can put your wanted plant straight into the hole, and the job is done for the morning. <br> Furthermore, you don&#39;t have to pull all the weeds out of an area, to plant a single plant. <br>With farmers friends particularly, remove one farmers friend, then plant your plant, but leave all the others crowding around, these other plants then provide an excellent wind break, and sun shade, and when your new plant is established, then you can begin clearing the bulk of the farmers friends away. <br> Additionally, the other best example for <b>If in doubt do nothing</b>, is pruning trees. <br> Never has the <b>If in doubt do nothing and one hour’s observation is worth ten hours’ work</b> ever been more forcefully applied. <br> A common desire for cutting branches off trees is because it’s blocking the view. <br> However before you do this, observe from inside your house, particularly in the hottest part of the day, you may find that while the branch blocks the view, it also provides shade. <br> So then you can spend a bit of time debating with yourself whether you want the shade or the view. And never forget that if it’s a deciduous tree (the leaves fall off in Autumn) then leaving the branch in place is almost certainly the way to go. <br> The leaves provide shade in summer, and then provide a view in the winter. If you can live with having the view for half the year, then you’ll save yourself some work and reduce your summer air conditioning bill to boot. <br><p></p><h3>4) There is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. </h3><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ma+'" alt=""><figcaption>Here the palm fronds are untidy</figcaption></figure> The best example I can give of this is to do with grass clippings. <br> Grass clippings on your path are considered unsightly, but collected in the catcher of the mower, and dumped carefully around your small carefully planted trees, provides weed retardation and soil cover. <br> So in the one movement in your garden you reduce the need for watering and weeding around your trees. <br> Palm fronds are another one. <br> Up here on the northern rivers, palm fronds drop like bombs for the whole summer, and are considered ugly and messy once they hit the ground. <br> However, instead of seeing them as a waste product, the best action is to strip the leaves bit of the frond, and use that as mulch, and then dispose of the remaining stalk and blade part onto a pile somewhere in your garden. <br><br> So immediately I hear you ask, ‘well isn’t the stalk and blade bit now waste?’ <br> Well, yes and no, what you do is put the pile of now denuded palm fronds in an area where you would like to create a new garden in the future. <br> The heavy fronds stacked up will kill any grass or weeds underneath, and then when you’re ready to plant in your new garden, you pull the fronds way, or if they’re in an advanced stage of decomposition, leave them there, cover them with soil, and plant into your new earthen mound. <br> And the final note on this topic, and probably the best example, is sawdust. <br> Up here where I work, there are many, many, paths liad out around expensive homes that use pebbles. <br> Pebbles drive anyone like me who has to run a brush cutter across the area nuts. <br> You simply cannot whipper-snip near a pebble path without sooner rather than later, the spinning head of your machine picking up pebbles and throwing them around the garden, a danger of smashing windows, chipping car duco, smashing car windscreens and all the rest. <br> What’s more, you can’t walk on a pebble garden in bare feet, and pebbles are heavy, so making the path in the first place is an exercise in hard work. <br> A far better alternative for paths is to use sawdust, it’s soft underfoot, and does no damage of the whipper-snipper line picks it up and throws it. <br> The one problem (now) with sawdust as a path material is that it is quite expensive. <br> I was talking about this with a staff member in my local Bunnings store a couple of weeks ago. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+pa+'" alt=""><figcaption>Here the palm frond leaves, stripped from the blade and with some grass clippings, provide an excellent grass retardation ring around the avocado seedlings.</figcaption></figure> There must have been a time when sawdust was a waste product at the sawmill, and the mill may have had a difficult time wondering how to get rid of it. <br> But as time went by, and more and more home owners began to come to the mill and ask to buy some cubic metres of sawdust to use as mulch around the home, it would have quickly dawned on the mill’s owners that now sawdust was now a desirable product, and indeed a perfect example of rule four: there is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. <br> And closing rule four off I would add, that sawdust is problematic in a few ways in the modern era. One, it is unlikely that you would ever cut enough wood at home to provide enough sawdust to provide cover for your paths, and then we’re into should we be cutting that many trees down anyway to feed the mill with base product. <br> So instead of that, use grass clippings for your path. <br> Grass clippings from the mower are as soft as sawdust, they last a long time, you can walk on the clippings in bare feet, and you have an inexhaustible supply from mowing your lawn every two weeks. <br><div style="clear:both;"></div></article><article><h4>The sod&#39;s law section, and other fillers</h4> When I restarted this blog after the gap fighting off homelessness and general stress, I was minorly worried that I would run out of things to write about, however either my life is riven with annoying situations or I&#39;m doing life wrong. <br> Indeed one of the things I learned when I set out to be a writer was that if you&#39;re doing non-fiction, and trying to be somewhat humorous, as an author you have to have bad experiences, as they make the best stories. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+ba+'" alt=""><figcaption>My long journey on the bike was, like most of my life, crowned by disappointment. </figcaption></figure> For instance if you go travelling and your planes and buses are all on time, nothing breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and all your hotel reservations work perfectly and you never have to sleep in the transit lounge of the airport, who wants to read about that??!? <br> So this morning I decided I needed to ride my second bike across the river to the petrol station to pump the tyres up to their optimal 40psi. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ya+'" alt=""><figcaption>My long range, good bike, the mallee bull, is on the right, the let-it-rust banger is on the left.</figcaption></figure> I thought long and hard about it, as my second bike is not the right size, and is a bit uncomfortable to ride. <br> I bought it because I didn&#39;t want to ride my good bike - given to me with much gratitude by Col Stokes - to the beach each day, as that means it rusts up as quick as lightning, and every six months the cables, cassette and chain have to be replaced. <br> So I bought an old banger from the hock shop for $50, and it&#39;s been working well as my let-it-rust bike. <br> So I headed across the river on the ferry and sure enough, after doing all that uncomfortable riding, I discovered that the petrol station had had to remove the pump because it was faulty. <br> Sigh. <br> However things worked out well, turns out my excellent neighbour, Sef, has an electric pump with guage, and upon my return, he came over and pumped up my tyres for me, thank you Sef. <br> Which only adds to the sighing in its way, why the fudge didn&#39;t I ask around before I cycled all that way?? <br> One day I&#39;ll learn I spose, but don&#39;t bank on it, sixty years have gone by and I haven&#39;t woken up yet. <div style="clear:both;"></div><br><br><br><br><h3>Change the name?</h3><br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+wa+'" alt=""><figcaption>The beautiful site of my RiverRobics. </figcaption></figure> Finally, I have been doing a lot of physiotherapy work on my chronically injured right hip and ankle, to do this I mostly ride the let-it-rust bike down to the river, and do a form of aquarobics in the water, I call it RiverRobics. <br> It&#39;s great down there, but the problem is it is yet another activity I do alone, and since loneliness is one of my problems these days, I thought maybe I would start going to the gym again, and working out there. <br> So I checked the search engine for gyms in Ballina, and discovered this one, which I would think either has to change its name, or start f***ing opening 24 hours. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+_a+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div

WordPress, you just made the list</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ka+'" alt="Homer revenge"><figcaption>Homer&#39;s revenge list</figcaption></figure> I was musing during the week on a range of topics, wondering what to write about here, and I began thinking that…, actually, scratch that and let me start again.<br> I was FUMING during the week, as usual, thinking of the f**ing range of people that infest my life these days, people who seem to take pleasure in going out of their way to make the lives of those who they encounter as hard as possible, and that of course reminded me of something I saw on The Simpsons, a show which has brought enormous pleasure into my life, and almost always provides a good graphic to highlight the point I’m trying to make.<br> Here it’s of course Homer’s revenge list, and that reminded me that it’s time I updated mine.<br> So I suppose to start, you may have noticed that the blog is in a new location this week, now that’s because of the constant crap that the major players on the internet seek to dispense to the ordinary digital citizens like me who are just trying to do some writing each week, and share it with friends.<br> To explain, I started this recent manifestation of the blog on WordPress for a few reasons but one of the main ones was about finding work in the current phase of my life.<br> I like being a gardener, but what I don’t like much is the constant driving I have to do to do my work.<br> Most weeks these days I drive 400 kilometres to get around my various clients’ houses and do the mowing, weeding and brush-cutting.<br> So going back a few months, well maybe even a year or so, I thought I would explore going back to computer programming.<br> That can be very stressful, but it does have the major upside that it can be done at home, indeed with servers and remote access, the computer programming industry was of course one of the leaders being able to employ people in another city, another state, and even another country.<br> I rang a few digital houses in my local area, and one guy I spoke with here in Ballina, Ben, opined that there wasn’t much call for my main programming specialties, but most sites he worked up for clients were six to eight page websites for small businesses, all done in WordPress.<br> So I figured I better learn WordPress.<br> I was reasonably successful (I feel) at this, however almost every time I learned something about that fat, bloated hog of a software package, I became correspondingly increasingly disenchanted with it, and it slowly dawned on me that I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life fiddling about inside the admin panel of WordPress websites, trying to solve the latest problem that was caused by other people’s code.<br> So at around that point I began to give up on the idea of going back to computer programming as a job.<br> And that led, in a roundabout way, to me musing on what I really wanted to do in life, and thus, and thankfully, I recalled that I always wanted to be a writer.<br> So I thought I would start the blog again, and get back in practice.<br> However, as a compromise, I thought I would do the blog on a WordPress free site, and at least keep my hand in with WordPress programming.<br> So I wrote two posts there, but by the time I’d done the second one, I began to notice that there was a formatting bug in the WordPress code.<br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+xa+'" alt="The WordPress formatting bug"><figcaption>The WordPress formatting bug</figcaption></figure> The figure on the left here shows the problem.<br> The paragraphs in green are correctly formatted, while the ones in red show that by this stage I’d already lost patience with it, and just published them as they were.<br> I write these posts in journalistic style, which means every sentence is its own paragraph.<br> So when you hit a full stop, you hit enter, and a new paragraph is automatically started for you.<br> However with WordPress this wasn&#39;t the case, what you had to do was go to the end of the paragraph, hit the space bar, then hit the enter button, and then WordPress would add two lines, instead of the correct only one line.<br> So I hit the delete on the second line, and that just sent the whole thing back to there being no new line at all.<br> So fuming at that, I worked on it and discovered that the solution was even more finicky and blood-pressure raising than I would have believed possible.<br> You had to do all of the above, then cursor down to the start of the new paragraph, then make sure your cursor symbol was hard up against the left margin, then hit delete from there.<br> This solved the problem, but then I realised as mentioned above, I would have to write the whole post, and then go down and make all these finicky and enraging changes for each paragraph.<br> And that’s when I said: ‘fuck this’ and WordPress made the list.<br> So then I decided to go back and check my old blog site, where I can remember never having this enraging problem, and see if I could start using that site again and write stuff without having my blood pressure raised to levels that would make a heart surgeon gibber.<br> However once I got over there, I discovered a new problem that was in its way, even worse.<br> Turns out that you need some sort of privacy policy to explain to your readers what data you are collecting on them, or more enragingly accurately, what data Google and WordPress are collecting from your blog.<br> The moment I read that it immediately occurred to me that since both Blogger and WordPress registered page views, that meant they were collecting some form of data, so with yet another lugubrious sigh I realised I was going to have to do some research and write, or get a privacy policy.<br> Now needless to say, once I began looking into a privacy policy, it quickly became evident, that this was no easy task.<br> There are some free privacy policy generator sites on the web, but when I went there, thinking that should make it easy but discovered that these sites ask a series of questions that I had no idea of the answers to, and so with, once again, my blood pressure rising to nuclear overload levels, I decided that I’m not gonna do that either.<br> Since I didn’t really know what data Google, who now own the Blogspot website, or WordPress were collecting, I couldn’t fill out the questions, since I had no real idea of the answers, and, as ever with these bloody things, most of the info I’d garnered from the web indicated that having a privacy policy that was wrong, or at least incomplete, was as legally problematic as not having one at all, I gave up on the whole idea decided to do my own blog at my GitHub repository.<br> Here I can control what does, and doesn’t, go on the page, and thus has a measure of peace of mind about you, the reader visiting the site.<br> So here is the privacy policy, the blog is now just a simple HTML page that you can read.<br> There are no ‘subscribe’, ‘like’ or comments section, and I certainly am not collecting any data at all.<br> So you can just go on the site, read it, hopefully enjoy it, and then leave.<br> If you wish to comment, you can do so back at Facebook which is the only place I share the new blog site on social media.<br> So there we have it, that&#39;s why WordPress are now on my list. <br> I won&#39;t share the full list with you, because as you would suspect from my eternal complaining, the list is now so long that I need a whole server, not just a single page, to write it fully. </article><article><h2>The only thing worse than</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Sa+'" alt="Wilde"></figure> Also during the week, I ran into some old friends from Byron, Barb and Ivan, we had a good chat, and during that Ivo (I think), came up with a Wildean doublet, that seemed pretty funny at the time <br> The topic was divorce and marriage, and tho I can’t remember how the topic came up, we laughed together over the end summary of it, which was: <br> ‘The only thing worse than getting divorced is getting married in the first place’. <br> So there’s a philosophy for life than we can all muse on. <br> And quick PS: I&#39;m not referring here to my ex-wife, she deserved better than me as a young man, arrogant, uncaring, selfish and entitled young shit that I was. <br> And of course, the final word on Wildean doublets is (almost inevitably) Monty Python. <br> There is a famous sketch where the accepted wits and thinkers of the day are gathered around the king and are engaged in constant flattery of the royal. <br> However the wits get involved in a round of trying to get the others in trouble, and so end up making increasingly derogatory remarks about the king, and so..., well anyway, rather than me try to explain it, you can find that sketch here: <a

bear sat on it</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Ba+'" alt=""></figure> Last post I was writing about the mosquitoes of Canada, how large and ferocious they are, and afterward I was talking with a friend who had also lived in Canada, and he mentioned in passing that apart from the mozzies, outdoor life in Canada is also enlivened, often for short electric periods of enlivenedness (if that&#39;s a word), by bears. <br> Now I won&#39;t presume to discourse on bears, there are plenty of great sources for you to read if the topic of the genus ursus interests you. <br> Probably the best I feel is Bill Bryson&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods_(book)">A Walk in the Woods.</a><br> But my friend&#39;s conversation did remind me, for some reason, of the time I went to borrow a tent from a work colleague. <br> I was living in Vancouver at the time, and was having a sort of long distance relationship with a woman who was living in Los Angeles. <br> We had decided that I would fly into LAX, and then we&#39;d drive in her car up the Pacific Coast Highway to San Francisco, camp in Golden Gate park, and see the sites and the wilderness of the Bay area. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Ca+'" alt=""><figcaption>Golden Gate Park, California</figcaption></figure> My female friend was providing the car, but she said to me: &#39;<i> can you get a tent?</i>&#39; <br> So I asked around at work - I was Greenpeace at the time - and so most people working there were wilderness lovers of one form or another, usually fully accoutred with all sorts of outdoor gear, so I felt that was a reasonable place to start. <br> [Side note: going down to Kmart and spending $20 on a tent just didn&#39;t occur to me, another of my life-long failings has been that I was, perhaps am, a cheapskate beyond belief, but I&#39;m working on getting better.] <br> But leaving my cheapskatedness aside, a work colleague was able to help, she said: &#39;<i> I&#39;ve got a tent you can borrow, it&#39;s a two-person pup tent, you can sleep in it, but one end is really deformed, so you have to make sure you set it up right, so the zipper door is at the end that&#39;s still intact.</i>&#39; <br> So I asked: &#39;<i>Oh, why is it deformed?</i>&#39; <br> To which she replied: &#39;<i>A bear sat on it.</i>&#39; <br> When I thought of that moment again, now, 35 years later, I&#39;m cursing myself for not getting the full story. Good grief, what sort of bloody journalist am I if I&#39;ve been given that sort of lead in, and then didn&#39;t follow up and find out just what on Earth scenario led to someone having a bear sit on their tent, and also were able to live to tell the tale? <br> I can only say that I was a young man in a hurry, like all young people I guess, but as you may also know, I&#39;m very down on myself these days, constantly berating myself for being such a selfish and arrogant young man, uncaring of other people&#39;s feelings and unwilling to listen to anything except the sound of my own voice. <br> And please note, I&#39;m not trying to manipulate anyone&#39;s response here, not looking for: &#39;you weren&#39;t that bad Lock&#39;. <br> Sadly that was genuinely the case, and it&#39;s left me with some large gaping holes in my life as I think back to opportunities for a better life lost because of my selfishness. <br> Anyway, this wasn&#39;t a large hole in the life, but it was certainly something I wished I&#39;d asked more about. <br> So we are thrown back on conjecture, and I am going to guess that what happened was that the owner of the tent was camping somewhere in the wilds of Canada, and at some point a bear came wandering into their camp area, looking for food. <br> The owner of the tent, and those camping nearby, if any, quickly ran as fast as possible to the nearest solid shelter, perhaps a camping hut, a ranger&#39;s station, or possibly their nearby parked cars. <br> Once safe inside a solid enclosure, they were able to watch the bear patrol about, sniffing for food, and at some point the bear found some food, ripped it from its basket or esky, and then sat down at the nearest point to enjoy a leisurely repast. <br> Or, the bear waffled about, found no food, and then sat down to have an enjoyable scratch before heading to the next campground to see if there was any food there. <br> In either scenario, the fact that the bear&#39;s chosen sitting point happened to be already occupied by the south end of my work friend&#39;s tent, I&#39;m sure never crossed the mind of the bear at any point. <br> My work friend&#39;s tent was of this style, two triangle frames at each end. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Ea+'" alt=""><figcaption>The tent, pre-bear sitting</figcaption></figure><br> Once it had been, er, reshaped by the bear - so my work friend told me - the end had changed to something like this: <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Pa+'" alt=""><figcaption>The tent deformed</figcaption></figure><br> Anyway, so there you have it, if you do head into the wild&#39;s of Canada and have trouble with bears, hope with all your might that the bear sitting on the end of your tent is the worst of it. [And that you&#39;re not in the tent if that happens] <div style="clear:both;"></div></article><article><h3>My love/hate relationship with the Burns Point ferry</h3><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Oa+'" alt=""></figure> I was reading once that Charles Darwin, of course best known for Origin of the Species and the theory of evolution, also did an exhaustive study of barnacles. <br> It took him nine years and at the end he wrote in his journal: I mention that because my new home is on the south side of the river at Ballina, and while I like it well enough, it comes with a slight inconvenience if you wish to drive into the shops at Ballina, that you have to take the ferry across the river at Burns Point. <br> On bike riding days, I positively love coming over the river on the ferry. <br> However on work days, in my car of course, and in a hurry to get to my garden client&#39;s place, the waiting around for the ferry has already begun to grate on me. <br> I&#39;ve been in South Ballina two months, and during the week, with a big job to be done up at Coorabell, I got the worst scenario, arriving at the southern ferry dock and seeing the ferry having just departed. <br> This meant a ten to fifteen minute wait while the ferry went across, disgorged its cars and trucks, then reloaded, and came back for me and the other cars waiting in the line. <br> And as I sat there this day, it occurred to me that tho I&#39;ve only been living in South Ballina for two months, I&#39;ve come to hate waiting for the Burns Point ferry as much as Charles Darwin hated barnacles. <br> And I can already hear some of you saying: &#39;<i> Lock, if the biggest thing you&#39;ve got to complain about is waiting on the banks of a beautiful river to take a short smooth boat ride, then you&#39;ve got problems.</i>&#39; <br> To which I reply I know that, I do indeed have big problems, that&#39;s why I see a clinical psychologist once a month, and additionally, the whole point of this blog is for me to complain, so there&#39;s that as well. Now that I think about it, I&#39;ll check with him next time I see him, but my therapist Simon is probably the happiest person around at the moment because I&#39;m doing the blog again. <br> Not because what I write uplifts him to a near seraphic, angelic height of good feeling, but because now I&#39;ve got an outlet to whinge constantly to, that is, the internet, it means that I don&#39;t have to do it all in an hour with Simon as a captive audience frantically watching the clock and praying for the incessant torrent of compaining spewing forth from me to stop. <br></article><p></p>',3),Ma=it({__name:"Post_2",setup(e){return(t,o)=>ja}}),Ra="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/barts_lawyer_is_here.png",Fa="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/mosquito_statue.png",$a="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/Kooteney_NP.png",Ha=k("h2",null,"Bart's lawyer is here",-1),Na=k("figure",{class:"rightImage"},[k("img",{src:Ra,alt:""})],-1),Wa=k("br",null,null,-1),Va=k("br",null,null,-1),La=k("br",null,null,-1),Da=k("br",null,null,-1),qa=k("br",null,null,-1),Ua=k("br",null,null,-1),Ka=k("br",null,null,-1),Ga=k("br",null,null,-1),za=k("br",null,null,-1),Ja=k("br",null,null,-1),Ya=k("i",null,"but I can't leave town, my shrink is here'.",-1),Xa=k("br",null,null,-1),Za=k("br",null,null,-1),Qa=k("i",null,"We have roots here, Homer.
