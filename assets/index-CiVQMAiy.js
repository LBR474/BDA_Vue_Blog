just have to hope that professional complainer is a real job</h2> When the disgustingly selfish and disgustingly rich woman who owned my apartment that I eventually got evicted from first decided to put it on the market right in the middle of COVID, I was furious for a lot of reasons. <br> Firstly, there was the completely gobsmacking realisation that this woman had just seen the suffering and death of millions of people across the world as an opportunity to make money. <br> COVID did a lot of things to the economy, nearly all of them bad, and one of them was the superheating of the housing market, certainly in Byron Bay. <br> I can’t exactly get it straight in my mind how or why this happened, you would think that with everyone at home because of the lockdowns, no one was selling or buying, so the prices should remain flat. <br> However like most things to do with economics counter-intuitive seems to be the watchword. <br> Indeed at this point I always remember something I read somewhere that sums the world of economics perfectly, the original quote is from Laurence J. Peter, and reads: <br> <code>‘An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn&#39;t happen today.’ </code> <br> But my recollection was of a slightly different wording, which was slightly clearer in its meaning (I feel): <br> <code> ‘economists can’t tell you what will happen tomorrow, but they can tell you why they were wrong yesterday’. </code> <br> Anyway, if interested in why the housing market super-balloooned in price in many places across Australia, you can find various sources on your favourite search engine to explain this better than me. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ea+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> The upshot of this appalling, gobsmacking levels of cynicism from the cow who held my accommodation destiny in her hands was that one way or another, I had to start frantically exploring options for somewhere else to live. <br> As mentioned previously, I quickly discerned from looking at RealEstate.com and other sites that I couldn&#39;t afford anywhere in my home town of Byron Bay, not by a long chalk, so I began to explore the idea of getting some work, preferably at a higher pay rate, so that when the end came, I was at least an outside chance of finding somewhere to live that didn’t involve a daily contest with the cockroaches and rats to decide who really owned the place. <br> I’ve had four main careers in my life: teacher, journalist, computer programmer and gardener. <br> And with the axe poised over my lovely life in Byron Bay, I figured my best chance of work that would allow me to pay for a flat in Byron Bay would be computer programming. When I first worked in IT in Sydney in the 90s I was a web designer, and became most adept at a language called javascript. <br> So with the immediate need to earn some bucks, I opened up my memory banks and began doing a bit of programming to see if I was up to the challenge of getting a job in this industry again. <br> I made up a few pages using HTML and JavaScript and as I did, I began to notice that the JavaScript I was studying was being constantly referred to as &quot;vanilla JavaScript&quot;. <br> I didn’t think too much about that, until the day came when I rang a recruitment consultant in Brisbane to discover what my chances of getting programming work were. The result of that phone call was that my chances were zero, probably less than zero given the other invisible factors that stalked that conversation, more on that later. <br><p></p> And just to break out of that for a second, with my chances of higher paying computer work being accurately described as: ‘lucky to be zero’, that reminded me a couple of amusing lines aligned with this from the world of sport. <br> One was ABC rugby league commentator Warren Ryan saying one day - of a team that had performed abysmally: <code> ‘they were lucky to get nil’.</code> <br><p></p> And Billy Connolly on soccer in Glasgow. <br> To set the scene, in Glasgow, as I’m sure you all probably know, soccer is king, it’s an obsession with the local inhabitants that goes beyond mental illness really. <br> There are two major teams Glasgow Rangers (protestant) and Glasgow Celtic (catholic). <br> Almost all attention is focussed on these two teams, not just in Glasgow, but across Scotland as a whole. <br> Thus the third Glasgow team, Partick Thistle, rarely raises the attention needle above 0.1 when people gathered in pubs are talking Scottish soccer. <br> Partick Thistle are often not even in the top division, and are famous for losing more matches than they win, so Billy Connolly once gagged: <code> ‘I’d just like to point out that the team’s name is Partick Thistle F.C, not Partick Thistle NIL’.</code> <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+ta+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> So back to my search for work, as I spoke with the recruitment consultant and told her what I’d been studying, she opined that I would be lucky to get any work in my current state of readiness, I would have to learn what was called the JavaScript frameworks. <br> So after a few more words of conversation, the tone of which from her end was: I hope I never hear from you again, I only want to hear from highly experienced programmers who will work for low pay so I get my commission and don’t care about the rest, I rang off and went onto the ‘net to find out what these framework things were. <br> Even if you haven’t worked in computers, probably your experience with your mobile phone has already given you an understanding that software development is rapid to the point of lightning pace. <br> Almost everytime you go to the mobile phone repair store, they tell you some part, or all, of your phone is now outdated and is no longer supported, so you’ve got to buy a new phone. <br> Well software for web pages and ‘net development is exactly the same. <br> I had last worked in computers in about 2001, and now it was 2022, and so 22 years of breakneck speed changes to the JavaScript language meant that I effectively had to start all over again. <br> The JavaScript frameworks, at the time I began looking, were headed by three main brands, Angular (Google), React (hosted by Facebook) and Vue, written by a genius who used to work at Google. <br> To say they were different from vanilla JavaScript is like saying that black is different from white. <br> As I looked at it I realised that when it came to JavaScript, I spoke latin and the rest of the (employed) world spoke modern italian. <br> Just to outline it briefly, in the old days when I was doing javascript programming, things were at a leisurely pace in the work place - or maybe I was just a slack and lazy employee - you simply typed in your code, refreshed the page and saw if your code had worked. <br> However the modern frameworks are highly autoated, and are automatically compiled by the transpiler every time you make some changes to your code. <br> This is generally convenient, but brings - to me anyway - an added feeling of pressure with the code trnaspiler running at all times. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+oa+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> This is quite a good thing mostly, but for me as a learner, it was quite anxiety provoking as it meant that you now had to not only learn the language of javascript, which was like learning a foreign language, something many of us enjoy, but also you had to learn a whole lot of new stuff about package.json files, vite.config options and a host of complicated and terrifying things in the deeper recesses of your computer. <br> Added to which, JavaScript itself had an added layer to it in the modern era, called TypeScript. <br> THis is an inherently good idea, typescript is like an editor that looks at your code pre-run time, and tells you if there are any problems with your code, that are going to surface and cause bigger problems when the code runs live on the ‘net. <br> However as a raw, green beginner with typescript, I found the error messages hopelessly confusing. <figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+na+'" alt=""><figcaption>To give you a brief idea of the issues that can arise, this property error had to be solved by changing the code on a completely different page, something took me a long frustrating time to figure out.</figcaption></figure> Whenever these terrifying red lines appeared on my code page, I would groan internally as I knew it meant some hours, possibly days of research across the internet trying to find a solution to these problems. <br> Anyway, I continued with my studies and became I feel reasonably adept at the modern frameworks, typescript, package.json and all the rest. <br> My schedule was to do a project in Angular, one in React and one in Vue, then - as it turns out, in my hopeless naivete - I felt I would be ready to apply for jobs in the programming world. <br> So I began my study with Angular and produced a learning game for those doing Taekwondo. It went pretty well, but there were a few enraging moments. <br> And I would just like to ask some of you reading this, Michael and Stokesy particularly, to bare with me while I tell this story again. <br> You two have both heard this a couple of times in our phone calls, and so sorry you’ve now got to revisit it in written form. <br> The Angular JavaScript framework has a kind of formatting template that you can use called Angular Material. <br> I took a look at it, and liked how it looked, and so I decided to use it in my project, the taekwondo learning game. <br> So I went to the Angular Material tutorial website, and followed their instructions to install it. <br> I then tried to get it to run, but I began to get the console lit up in red like it was on fire, indicating that there was a bug(s) in my code. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ra+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> So I went back to the tutorial website, checked that I had followed the instructions correctly, and I had, but still my console looked like it had measles, with a rash of angry red crosses all over the readout telling me something was vastly wrong. <br> So then I began to widen my search onto the internet, particularly to the programmers forum, Stack Overflow, to try to find out what was wrong. <br> This went on for nearly three days, while I grew increasingly angry and frustrated, my hair began to pile up around me on the floor as I pulled huge chunks of it out, trying to get to the bottom of this error(s). <br> Anyway, more by chance than good technique on my part, I was reading a post on Stack Overflow that was sort of related to my problem and right at the bottom, someone had mentioned, almost as a throwaway line, that the poster of that problem, should check their version, because that can cause problems in Angular. <br> I didn’t think that could help me, but I was truly grasping at straws now, so I decided I had better at least do that. <br> Well it did solve the problem, but it did nothing for my blood pressure, and annoyance at Angular/Google for putting me through that. <br> It turns out that the command Google had told me to use on their tutorial website was out of date, and the numbers on my version list were way too low for me to be able to use Angular Material. <br> Moving on then with hope in my heart, I created a new project, installed manually a version level of Angular Material that the node package manager could work with, and the problem was solved. <br> However I was still f***ing fuming about that some weeks later when I completed my project. <br> Having done what set out to do with Angular it was time to work on a React project, which I did, and then began a Vue project and completed that. (This blog site is made with Vue by the way). <br> In neither React nor Vue did I have anywhere near the levels of hair-tearing and fuming that Angular gave me, so before it was time to come around in the cycle back to Angular again, I checked the ‘net for usage figures on the three frameworks. <br> Turns out Angular was way down now at only 22% of developers using it, with React the most popular (at that time) and Vue coming along behind React towards the top of the pile. <br> That was enough for me, I decided to never willingly use Angular again. <br> A lesson for bloody Google, if you want to retain your popularity with developers, update your f**ing tutorial website. <br> As a raw beginning learner, I’ve got enough problems without you putting the wrong commands on the damn ‘how-to’ website. <br> So with my three projects in the main frameworks complete, I now felt I was ready to at least begin applying for jobs, but immediately a host new problems began to surface and overwhelm my intent. <br> And at this point I was reminded of another time I faced head-beating-against-the-wall confounding paradoxes like this. <br> In the 90s I was working in computers in the corporate world of Sydney and already starting to understand that I didn’t want to do this for the rest of my life, so I reactivated my always just-beneath-the-surface desire to be a writer. <br> Back then you could still make a living as a writer, even become rich if you were prepared to write soft porn, or hopelessly commercial novels with a lot of sex on them. I wasn’t prepared to do that, but was taken with the idea of seeing my name on the spine of a book in the local book store, so I wrote my first book: How Not to Build a Mud Brick House. <br> It was, like all first draft of first novels by anyone I guess, really, really bad. <br> It described me buying some land outside Byron Bay and building a mud brick house on it, then leaving the corporate world of Sydney and going up there and doing nothing for the rest of my life except surfing, growing organic veggies in my garden and spending the rest of my time staring out the window at the view. <br> So much I didn’t understand, mostly just how much money you needed to buy anything in Byron Bay, even back then. <br> If you were lucky you could afford a dog kennel, to buy a house, flat or even some land, you had to enslave yourself to a mortgage and then spend the rest of your career stuck in Sydney writing JavaScript code till you expired of a heart attack and never got the chance to live on your land and stare out the window, thanks a f***Ing lot big four banks of Australia. <br> Anyway, leaving that aside, and returning to the initial paradox of life as a writer, I worked away at my novel and eventually finished it, and in my hopeless delusion, thought: ‘ok, that’s the hard part done, now to contact some publishers’. <br> So I printed out some copies, and got them bound by the print shop at Compaq computers, where I was working at the time, then one lunchtime I took five copies of my book down to the post office and sent it to five publishers. <br> Then I waited. <br> I hesitate to write ‘in my hopeless naivete’ more than fifty times per post, but even as I recollect that time, nothing else really sums up my perpetually deluded state of mind that I had as an arrogant and foolish younger man. <br> Moving on, after some weeks of waiting, I began to feel that I should have heard from at least one, if not all of the publishers I had sent to, expecting (in my hopeless naivete) that they would have read it by now and were, now in the process of contacting me to tell me they would be publishing my book and by the end of the year would have sold some thousands of copies and I would soon be if not rich, at least comfortably living on the background income of book royalties pouring in. <br> But with no word, I felt I better get proactive, so I rang one of the publishers. There I spoke with a helpful person, and even that was something of a miracle, as that conversation made me realise. <br> I say miracle, because publishers are so swamped that even getting someone to answer the phone is a something of a rarity, compare with the modern era where no company answers the phone but simply advises you in the voice answer message to go to their website and look at the Frequently Asked Questions page and see if that helps with your query, meaning: f*** off and don’t bother us. <br> Anyway the helpful person at the publishers told me that they don’t take unsolicited manuscripts, <code>‘we only publish books sent to us by literary agents’. </code> So I rang off and went to the yellow pages for Sydney and looked up literary agents, and there were three listed as I recall.I rang the first one in the book and they told me: <code>‘we won’t take you on unless you’ve already been published’. </code> <br> So with a snarling groan at the unfairness of life (as I saw it), my literary ambitions died for the moment. <br> There was back then a thing called vanity publishing, where you publish your own book, and then hawk it around book stores hoping they would put it on the shelf, but I was not really prepared to do that. <br> There have been successes using this process, Mathew Reilly, the thriller writer, began this way, and I suppose I could have done that, but as I look back on it, that just all seemed too hard. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ia+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> I think I felt hard done by in a way, feeling, as mentioned above, that I had already done the hard part by writing and completing the book, so felt (in my hopeless naivete) that it wasn’t fair that I now had to begin an even harder part by self-publishing and walking around Sydney trying to convince book store owners to put my book on the shelf. <br> Anyway, leaving the past where it was, there were bigger factors at play ruling the world of publishers and literary agents, and that was the end of publishing on paper itself. <br> Coming forwards to the modern era, I wrote my second book, Long Way Round to Rehab and published it on the internet at SmashWords. <br> So in its way I am a published author, and with a third book in my mind now, I can happily bypass the whole agent-publisher quagmire and do it whenever I like. And just to close this post down, I like being a gardener, I really do, but the big down side is the driving. <br> In most working weeks I drive 300-400 kilometres, and I really hate that. <br> It’s not a sustainable life, all those fossil fuel fumes I burn getting to my gardening clients houses seem to make a mockery of styling myself as a sustainable maintenance gardener. <br> It - almost as ever - increases my fury at the woman who kicked me into the street, and the banks and conservative governments who caused this crippling financial pressure on lower and middle-income Australians. <br> To explain that, when I realised that I needed to get some more work, my first and best option was to rebuild my gardening business back up, so I did what I had done before, and put an ad in the Byron Shire Echo. <br> I was living not even in Ballina at the time, but worse than that, 30 k south of Ballina in a dead or alive town called Broadwater, and once again in my hopeless delusion, I honestly thought by the time build the gardening round back up to full speed, I will be living back in Byron shire, so the driving will be vastly reduced. <br> How wrong I was. <br> I am at least in Ballina now, and I do like it generally, but there is still a sixty k plus round trip to go work each working day, and that has rapidly become very waring. This of course adds to the problem of making enough money to move home, which is that all that driving cuts down on the profit for each hour’s work. <br> So, gardening is ok, but now certainly with winter coming on and less gardening work needing to be done, it was/is time to explore computer work again. <br> Computer work - even if I’m working for an employer in Brisbane or the gold coast - can be done from my desk here in Ballina, and it means I can get up at six a.m, make a coffee, and be at work at 6.05. <br> However my long absence from the industry, and that fact - that I now suspect - is that no one will employ a sixty year old man to do the sort of code that is cutting edge and groovy, they only really want to employ 23-year-olds fresh out of college. <br> In computer programming, and perhaps in all industries, there&#39;s an innate, and possibly barely seen or realised prejudice against older employees, in fact that&#39;s probably the case for society as a whole. <br> However I’ll keep exploring it, and with my new found confidence thanks to my therapist Simon, and supportive friends, I feel that I’ll eventually land something, and can reduce my driving to under 100 kilometres a week, or even better, move back to my home in Byron Bay, and work from my computer on my desk and recude my daily commute to work from 60-80 k down to two metres, the distance from the kitchen to the living room. <br> If that doesn’t work out as a computer programmer, or as a gardener, and it already hasn’t as a journalist or as a teacher, then I’m sure I can continue to build my career as a professional complainer, here on the blog. <br> As you can all see already, complaining as a career for me is absolutely going very successfully so far. <br> See you next week everybody. <br><div style="clear:both;"></div></article>',1),aa=[sa],la=Ke({__name:"Post_6",setup(e){return(t,o)=>(oe(),De("div",null,aa))}}),ha="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/Milan_San_Remo_Main_Image.png",ca="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/PArco_DelTicino_MIlan_San_Remo.png",ua="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/San_Bartolomeo_Mailan_San_Remo.png",da="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/Appalachian_wilderness.png",fa="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/Appalacian_trail_map.png",ga="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/D-Gen.png",ma="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/sunda_distancee.png",pa="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/sunda.jpeg",ya="/BDA_Vue_Blog/bike_racing_images/face_breakdown_small.png",ba=bt('<article><h2>Why I like watching bike racing on TV</h2><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+ha+'" alt=""><figcaption>Milan San Remo bike race.</figcaption></figure> A few months ago I was talking on the phone with my friend Michael, and I said: <i> ‘it’s a strange phase of life for me at the moment Michael, the only thing I really like to do is ride my own bike for 50 kilometres, then come home and watch other people ride their bikes for 200 kilometres’.</i> <br> Which made me think about why I like it so much. <br> I’ve written about this before, in the previous blog incarnation, but I’ll just mention it again as background. <br> In about the mid-noughties - which I think is the main nickname for the period from 2000-2009 - I began to descend unhappily, and frighteningly quickly into full-blown alcoholism. I always vaguely knew I had some depressive tendencies, but when that began to happen, I feel - looking back on it - that I had no idea just how depressed I had become. <br> If I had some work to do, I would go and do it, and if I could summon the energy after that, I would go surfing. <br> However on days with no work, I would often look out the window and try to find a reason to get through the day, often I couldn’t really find a reason to go out the front door, and so sadly my I-can-start-drinking time began to drift inexorably forwards. <br> When things got bad, I might start drinking at 11 o’clock in the morning, just under the heading of having nothing else to do. <br> This of course began to radically affect my sleeping patterns, and it is an easy step of logic to see that if you’re going to start imbibing at 11a.m, then by three or four pm you’re going to crash down into a restless, non-refreshing “sleep”. Then I would wake up perhaps at 9pm and be wide awake and unable to sleep at the customary hours humans sleep.<br> So I would turn on the TV and, ever so thankfully, as I recall, when this began to happen regularly, it was mid-winter, and so the Tour de France was on TV and so I began watching that as I waited for some form of sleepiness to return.<br> And immediately I fell in love with it, and gained a great deal of meditative pleasure from watching the kilometres disappear under the wheels of the cyclists, a pleasure which is still with me today.<br> Now, fifteen or so years later it occurred to me to wonder what it is about bike racing on TV that I continue to like so much, and write this post about it.<br> So first, and I think most obviously, there is the scenery.<br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+ca+'" alt=""></figure> Most sports that have large audiences are played in a single location, e.g. aussie rules, rugby league and cricket.<br> For those sports you hardly notice the stadium, your attention is focussed solely on the game.<br> However with bike racing, you follow the race through the country for 150-200 kilometres, seeing the beautiful scenery along the way as a supremely pleasant background to watching the race.<br> With stage racing, I should add, most stages are 150-200 kilometres long, and there is a general, informal, structure of the racing along the stage.<br> That is, at the beginning of the stage, a smaller group of riders rush frantically forwards and form a breakaway.<br> This smaller group then race onwards, two or three minutes ahead of the main group, the peloton, for the next hundred or so kilometres.<br> Most road racing is done at around 40 kph, and so for the first two and a half hours of the race on that day, things are pretty calm, all right, can be described as boring, as we watch the race mosey along with no positional changes from the riders.<br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+ua+'" alt=""></figure> So this calm period is actually something I like, I find it an aid to meditation, and the network covering the race know this as well, so they do their research and have lots of information about the various spots of interest the race passes along the way to bring up onto the bottom of the screen for the audience to read and learn about the countryside, history and culture of the country we are currently racing through.<br> So I think what I’m saying there is that even if you have no interest in bike racing, then you can watch the bike racing and just get enjoyment from the picturesque nature of the coverage.<br> Which leads to another point, John Muir was an american pioneer wilderness preservationist who was one of the founders of the Appalacian Trail hiking route down the eastern seaboard of the United States, and he famously <a href="https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/theres-the-back-fence-line-again/"> said</a> of the beauty of this wilderness that upon seeing it: <br> <i> ‘Who has not felt the urge to throw a loaf of bread and a pound of tea in an old sack and jump over the back fence?’ </i> <br><figure class="mainImage"><img src="'+da+'" alt=""><figcaption>The Appalachian wilderness</figcaption><img src="'+fa+'" alt=""><figcaption>The Appalachian trail</figcaption></figure> To which I would add, who can look the photos above of the Milan-San Remo bike race, and not want to immediately head down the tourist office and book a flight and go and see Italy? <br><br><br><h2>Now on to the complaining</h2> So bike racing is a thing I enjoy, but sadly that now leads us to the part you’ve all been dreading, which is the complaining part.<br> Before bike racing came into my life, my previous great enjoyment was watching test cricket on TV.<br> Test cricket has a slow rhythm and goes for six hours of the day and I found something relaxing in the slow paced tempo of this sport.<br> I’d lost a lot of interest in cricket for a while, but then about 2001 I got dumped, badly, by a woman who I had fallen deeply in love with.<br> With my life an empty, gray, barren plane of despair, and not drinking at the time as I’d finally realised that I had a problem, I found each day stretching before me like a prison sentence.<br> I hung around my home, smoking innumerable cigarettes - I hadn’t figured that one yet - and tried to pass my time.<br> One day I turned on the TV to see if anything there could occupy my mind, and discovered the cricket was on.<br> So I sat down to watch it.<br> It was a godsend in its way, I became immediately absorbed in the match, even more than I had been as a young child.<br> It wasn’t so much that I was interested in the outcome, it wasn’t something to do, it was more an absence of nothing.<br> While the cricket was on, and with the drone of Ian Chappell and the rest of the Channel Nine commentary team I could shut out the pain of my recent dumping.<br> There then began a new love affair with cricket that went on for the next ten to 15 years.<br> That love deepened when I realised you could listen to the ABC commentary with Jim Maxwell and the team in sync with the TV with the sound off, and thus the very quickly annoying Channel Nine commentary team turned down to zero volume.<br> However things began to change markedly in the modern era when Cricket Australia turned into a money hungry organisation, with no concern for test cricket fans, only how much money they could ring out of the wallets of anyone with a remote interest in the white-flannelled game.<br> So Cricket Australia began to sell the game we loved to the highest bidder, and allow the most appallingly destructive advertising to rule the sport.<br> Additionally, they worked out that there were a number of people like me who watched the game in silence and listened to the ABC - commercial free - commentary, and realised that meant we weren’t hearing the ads, and so changed the technicalities of the broadcast so that it was no longer possible to sync the ABC coverage with the TV.<br> And the worst of this advertising in my opinion is alcohol advertising.<br> There are sposed to be rules to stop the advertising of alcohol to children, but the advertising industry just ran roughshod over any sense of morality and had the rule changed so they could advertise alcohol to those underage.<br> So I tried to watch the test cricket with the ABC commentary but in the end, sooner or later an alcohol ad appeared, and this made me so angry that I just couldn’t enjoy the match, furious at this outrageous display of immorality from the advertising industry, Cricket Australia and the host broadcaster, then Channel Nine, now Channel Seven.<br> Since watching test cricket was supposed to be part of my therapy, and in fact it was only making me more angry, test cricket just had to go from my watching rotation.<br> Further to that, while advertising alcohol to children is just flat out wrong, I would go further and state that Australia needs no alcohol advertising at all.<br> As ever with these diatribes, I’m never calling for the banning of alcohol, as of prohibition in the US in the twenties, I am simply saying that anyone who wants a drink can have one, and knows where to get one, so why do we need any ads encouraging people to have a drink at 9.30 on Saturday morning when the test cricket broadcast begins? Answer: we don’t.<br> But as ever while I’m working to bring my blood pressure down to safe levels, as they are always inordinately exercised whenever I think about this outrageously amoral alcohol advertising, I’m reminded of where the counter to this was done best, on the D-Generation in the 80s.<br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ga+'" alt=""><figcaption>The D-Generation, one of the greatest shows ever produced in Australia</figcaption></figure> At that time the advertising industry brought out an ad, too fatuous for words, in which they tried to make people love advertising.<br> The theme of the ad was: <i> ‘in some countries they don’t have advertising to annoy them’.</i><br> It showed a family sitting around in their living room, surrounded by consumer durables, and one by one each item - couch, TV, fridge, etc - were removed from the family, and each time the stentorian voice over would say: <i> ‘in some countries they don’t have advertising to annoy them’. </i><br> Meaning, that without advertising you would not have any of the household items you hold dear. <br> Even as I think back to that utterly ridiculous ad, I find it impossible to believe that even the people who wrote that ad could possibly think that anyone would believe it, most notably the advertising industry trying to claim that the reason why there was a couch in your house was because you saw an ad on TV for couches, and were suddenly struck with the blindingly brilliant idea that instead of wallowing around on the floor, you should go out and buy something for your family to sit on.<br> This ad was just too moronic and enraging for words, however the D-Generation soon showed the utter idiocy and stupidity of that ad, they ran a spoof ad which followed the same pattern, of the family having their durables removed with the <i> ‘some countries don’t have advertising to annoy them’</i> voice over, but on the last one the D-Generation added: <b><i>‘we do’.</i></b><br><div style="clear:both;"></div></article><p><h2>Quirky corner</h2><article><h3>Long distance service</h3><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ma+'" alt=""></figure><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+pa+'" alt=""></figure> I pulled up short outside one of my local supermarkets, astounded at the service implied here. <br> I&#39;m not sure how this would work, but any commercial enterprise that offers to stay open for the full five and a half thousand kilometres, sure gets my vote!

After a few minutes of discussion Geoff, the instructor, called it to a halt and said, not in so many words: &#39;<i> you&#39;re all wrong, the answer is soil loss</i>&#39;. <br> He then proceeded to explain that, and it did make immediate sense. <br> His argument, and I came to fully agree, was that (This is if I recall properly) that although pollution, high extinction rates, climate change and all the rest were, and are, very bad things, they can all be worked on and solved with some effort. <br> Climate change can be immediately solved by closing coal mines and gas fields and moving with great energy to bring in more renewable energy and continuing the research to make all forms of renewable energy even more efficient. <br> However, soil loss is a problem that no amount of human effort can solve. <br> This is of course due to the phenomenally long time that it takes for the earth&#39;s geological processes to make soil in the first place. <br> When I was researching this I quickly had a check in case against all odds somehow, somewhere, some group had found a way to make soil, but of course that hasn’t happened. <br> There are various links that come up when you type ‘<i>Can humans make soil?</i>’ into your favourite search engine, but these all refer to not making soil, increasing the sum total of tonnes of soil on the Earth, but refer instead to getting various mixes of different types of soil that already exist, and blending them in different proportions to provide soils that do different things that humans want - soil specially for growing seeds, raising or lowering the pH etc. <br> One of my favourite authors, Kim Stanley Robinson went into this in some depth in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy"> Mars trilogy. </a><br> As Kim describes there, and it applies to Earth as well as Mars, or indeed any planet where humans plan to go in the future. <br> Soil can only really be made by geological processes. <br> In the Mars trilogy, the human engineers, agronomists and ecologists set up a research project where they see if they can make soil. <br> They create a huge installation with many giant steel incubating vats and they put various amounts of the poor martian soil, with microbes brought from Earth, plus organic matter and nematodes and suchlike crawling creatures and let it percolate away to see if it can produce useful soil. <br> However while it all works to a certain degree, the process is so slow, that it becomes a rather futile exercise. <br> Kim notes that given the results from all their huge steel vats at the engineering centre, the best they could hope for is to produce 1 centimetre of soil to cover the whole land area of Mars, and that would take a century to produce. <br> And please note, although Kim Stanley Robinson is a science fiction writer, I feel he is more than that, I prefer to call him an extrapolationist, someone who sees where we’re at now, and works methodically forwards to where he feels we will be at at certain future periods of history. <br> Thus I feel his scientific predictions are more than just stories, but good indicators of likely future outcomes. <br> So back here on Earth, all of that still applies to us, we can’t make soil, or we can’t make soil in a fashion that is of a speed that would be of any earthly (literally and metaphorically) any use to us. <br> The most fertile soil on Earth is generally thought to be volcanic soils (it’s the youngest, so stills contains its full complement of minerals and trace elements) and a workaround solution - you may suggest - is to get some volcanic rock, basalt say, and pulverise that into a fine powder, and then you have made some soil, which you could put in a bag, and sell to someone gardening on less than quality soil. <br> However, you can immediately see that the amount of energy you would need to smash the single concise rock into a powder is so massive, and would take so long, that once again we are behind the energy equation, and the “making” of soil in this way is a futile exercise. <br> And that ties the whole thing up fairly neatly to the original point, which is that bare soil is death, soil loss is a big problem, perhaps the biggest that humans face in the 21st century. <br> So whether you have a window box on the window sill of your kitchen containing three herb plants, or you&#39;re a broad acre farmer with 5,000 hectares in a rural area, cover your soil! <br> Not only does this reduce soil loss via runoff into the waterways, it provides you with immediate benefits of stopping evaporation, and protecting your plant roots from harsh baking summer sun and freezing, biting winter frosts. <br><p></p><h3>2) If in doubt, do nothing/One hour’s observation is worth ten hours work.</h3> <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Ia+'" alt=""><figcaption>Tradescantia fluminens</figcaption></figure> These two rules go well together, and are a pair of rules that most people latch onto with immediate glee, as it seems to be an excuse to do nothing in the garden, at least in the beginning. <br> Excuse or not, they are still valuable weapons in your armoury. <br> The example my permaculture teacher gave was to do with weeds. <br> People would work successfully in the city for many years in a high-paying job, and with the money piling up, they would then buy an acreage property outside Byron Bay. <br> Contracts would be exchanged, and finally the day would come when they could drive or fly up, and spend their first vacation on the land they had recently bought. <br> Almost as soon as there they would notice how overgrown with weeds the area had become, and they’d check the local department of agriculture website and learn that almost all the chest-high green growth they could see was “weeds” so they would go out and starting with the garden beds around the house, begin pulling the weeds out of the ground. <br> However this is almost immediately counter-productive, as for one thing, it just exposes the soil and takes us almost immediately back to rule 1) bare soil is death. <br> A far better way to tackle the weed “problem” on your land, is to spend the first holiday up there just observing what is happening on your land, and making some minor notes. <br> One of the observations that is probably first and foremost is what type of weeds are growing where. Tradescantia, for instance, grows best in shaded, mostly moist areas. <br> [NB: tradescantia has a common name that is quite racially derogatory, so I won’t use it, but will just provide a picture of this plant instead] <br> So observe where the tradescantia is growing, and resolve to plant something in that area that has a similar growth habit. <br> As I recall, basil and tomatoes grow well together, and like the same sort of ground that the tradescantia is growing on. <br> So instead of pulling the trad out of the ground on your first holiday, leave it there, go down to your local organic nursery, buy some good quality tomatoes and basil, then come home, clear a small amount of trad away and plant your basil and tomatoes in the small clearing you have created. <br> Farmer’s friends are another one. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+ka+'" alt=""><figcaption>Farmers friends</figcaption></figure> Why this weed is called Farmer’s Friends is a matter for some debate, still. <br> One opinion is that the burrs of the Farmer’s Friends are so numerous and stick to your clothing so relentlessly, that a farmer walking in an overgrown field quickly becomes covered in the prickles and it looks like the farmer has lots of friends clinging to them. <br> However what I’ve found is that this weed is ultimately a brilliant aid to the home gardener. When you pull it out of the ground, and it comes out very easily, it leaves a small hole perfect for you to plant in, so, like the tradescantia above, don’t just pull the plant out of the ground the moment you see it, but instead note where they are growing, find a plant that looks similar, then when you’re ready to plant, pull the Farmer’s Friend out of the ground, and with no digging, even with a hand trowel, you can put your wanted plant straight into the hole, and the job is done for the morning. <br> Furthermore, you don&#39;t have to pull all the weeds out of an area, to plant a single plant. <br>With farmers friends particularly, remove one farmers friend, then plant your plant, but leave all the others crowding around, these other plants then provide an excellent wind break, and sun shade, and when your new plant is established, then you can begin clearing the bulk of the farmers friends away. <br> Additionally, the other best example for <b>If in doubt do nothing</b>, is pruning trees. <br> Never has the <b>If in doubt do nothing and one hour’s observation is worth ten hours’ work</b> ever been more forcefully applied. <br> A common desire for cutting branches off trees is because it’s blocking the view. <br> However before you do this, observe from inside your house, particularly in the hottest part of the day, you may find that while the branch blocks the view, it also provides shade. <br> So then you can spend a bit of time debating with yourself whether you want the shade or the view. And never forget that if it’s a deciduous tree (the leaves fall off in Autumn) then leaving the branch in place is almost certainly the way to go. <br> The leaves provide shade in summer, and then provide a view in the winter. If you can live with having the view for half the year, then you’ll save yourself some work and reduce your summer air conditioning bill to boot. <br><p></p><h3>4) There is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. </h3><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+xa+'" alt=""><figcaption>Here the palm fronds are untidy</figcaption></figure> The best example I can give of this is to do with grass clippings. <br> Grass clippings on your path are considered unsightly, but collected in the catcher of the mower, and dumped carefully around your small carefully planted trees, provides weed retardation and soil cover. <br> So in the one movement in your garden you reduce the need for watering and weeding around your trees. <br> Palm fronds are another one. <br> Up here on the northern rivers, palm fronds drop like bombs for the whole summer, and are considered ugly and messy once they hit the ground. <br> However, instead of seeing them as a waste product, the best action is to strip the leaves bit of the frond, and use that as mulch, and then dispose of the remaining stalk and blade part onto a pile somewhere in your garden. <br><br> So immediately I hear you ask, ‘well isn’t the stalk and blade bit now waste?’ <br> Well, yes and no, what you do is put the pile of now denuded palm fronds in an area where you would like to create a new garden in the future. <br> The heavy fronds stacked up will kill any grass or weeds underneath, and then when you’re ready to plant in your new garden, you pull the fronds way, or if they’re in an advanced stage of decomposition, leave them there, cover them with soil, and plant into your new earthen mound. <br> And the final note on this topic, and probably the best example, is sawdust. <br> Up here where I work, there are many, many, paths liad out around expensive homes that use pebbles. <br> Pebbles drive anyone like me who has to run a brush cutter across the area nuts. <br> You simply cannot whipper-snip near a pebble path without sooner rather than later, the spinning head of your machine picking up pebbles and throwing them around the garden, a danger of smashing windows, chipping car duco, smashing car windscreens and all the rest. <br> What’s more, you can’t walk on a pebble garden in bare feet, and pebbles are heavy, so making the path in the first place is an exercise in hard work. <br> A far better alternative for paths is to use sawdust, it’s soft underfoot, and does no damage of the whipper-snipper line picks it up and throws it. <br> The one problem (now) with sawdust as a path material is that it is quite expensive. <br> I was talking about this with a staff member in my local Bunnings store a couple of weeks ago. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Sa+'" alt=""><figcaption>Here the palm frond leaves, stripped from the blade and with some grass clippings, provide an excellent grass retardation ring around the avocado seedlings.</figcaption></figure> There must have been a time when sawdust was a waste product at the sawmill, and the mill may have had a difficult time wondering how to get rid of it. <br> But as time went by, and more and more home owners began to come to the mill and ask to buy some cubic metres of sawdust to use as mulch around the home, it would have quickly dawned on the mill’s owners that now sawdust was now a desirable product, and indeed a perfect example of rule four: there is no such thing as waste, only an unused resource. <br> And closing rule four off I would add, that sawdust is problematic in a few ways in the modern era. One, it is unlikely that you would ever cut enough wood at home to provide enough sawdust to provide cover for your paths, and then we’re into should we be cutting that many trees down anyway to feed the mill with base product. <br> So instead of that, use grass clippings for your path. <br> Grass clippings from the mower are as soft as sawdust, they last a long time, you can walk on the clippings in bare feet, and you have an inexhaustible supply from mowing your lawn every two weeks. <br><div style="clear:both;"></div></article><article><h4>The sod&#39;s law section, and other fillers</h4> When I restarted this blog after the gap fighting off homelessness and general stress, I was minorly worried that I would run out of things to write about, however either my life is riven with annoying situations or I&#39;m doing life wrong. <br> Indeed one of the things I learned when I set out to be a writer was that if you&#39;re doing non-fiction, and trying to be somewhat humorous, as an author you have to have bad experiences, as they make the best stories. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Aa+'" alt=""><figcaption>My long journey on the bike was, like most of my life, crowned by disappointment. </figcaption></figure> For instance if you go travelling and your planes and buses are all on time, nothing breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and all your hotel reservations work perfectly and you never have to sleep in the transit lounge of the airport, who wants to read about that??!? <br> So this morning I decided I needed to ride my second bike across the river to the petrol station to pump the tyres up to their optimal 40psi. <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Ta+'" alt=""><figcaption>My long range, good bike, the mallee bull, is on the right, the let-it-rust banger is on the left.</figcaption></figure> I thought long and hard about it, as my second bike is not the right size, and is a bit uncomfortable to ride. <br> I bought it because I didn&#39;t want to ride my good bike - given to me with much gratitude by Col Stokes - to the beach each day, as that means it rusts up as quick as lightning, and every six months the cables, cassette and chain have to be replaced. <br> So I bought an old banger from the hock shop for $50, and it&#39;s been working well as my let-it-rust bike. <br> So I headed across the river on the ferry and sure enough, after doing all that uncomfortable riding, I discovered that the petrol station had had to remove the pump because it was faulty. <br> Sigh. <br> However things worked out well, turns out my excellent neighbour, Sef, has an electric pump with guage, and upon my return, he came over and pumped up my tyres for me, thank you Sef. <br> Which only adds to the sighing in its way, why the fudge didn&#39;t I ask around before I cycled all that way?? <br> One day I&#39;ll learn I spose, but don&#39;t bank on it, sixty years have gone by and I haven&#39;t woken up yet. <div style="clear:both;"></div><br><br><br><br><h3>Change the name?</h3><br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Ba+'" alt=""><figcaption>The beautiful site of my RiverRobics. </figcaption></figure> Finally, I have been doing a lot of physiotherapy work on my chronically injured right hip and ankle, to do this I mostly ride the let-it-rust bike down to the river, and do a form of aquarobics in the water, I call it RiverRobics. <br> It&#39;s great down there, but the problem is it is yet another activity I do alone, and since loneliness is one of my problems these days, I thought maybe I would start going to the gym again, and working out there. <br> So I checked the search engine for gyms in Ballina, and discovered this one, which I would think either has to change its name, or start f***ing opening 24 hours. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Ca+'" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div

WordPress, you just made the list</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Pa+'" alt="Homer revenge"><figcaption>Homer&#39;s revenge list</figcaption></figure> I was musing during the week on a range of topics, wondering what to write about here, and I began thinking that…, actually, scratch that and let me start again.<br> I was FUMING during the week, as usual, thinking of the f**ing range of people that infest my life these days, people who seem to take pleasure in going out of their way to make the lives of those who they encounter as hard as possible, and that of course reminded me of something I saw on The Simpsons, a show which has brought enormous pleasure into my life, and almost always provides a good graphic to highlight the point I’m trying to make.<br> Here it’s of course Homer’s revenge list, and that reminded me that it’s time I updated mine.<br> So I suppose to start, you may have noticed that the blog is in a new location this week, now that’s because of the constant crap that the major players on the internet seek to dispense to the ordinary digital citizens like me who are just trying to do some writing each week, and share it with friends.<br> To explain, I started this recent manifestation of the blog on WordPress for a few reasons but one of the main ones was about finding work in the current phase of my life.<br> I like being a gardener, but what I don’t like much is the constant driving I have to do to do my work.<br> Most weeks these days I drive 400 kilometres to get around my various clients’ houses and do the mowing, weeding and brush-cutting.<br> So going back a few months, well maybe even a year or so, I thought I would explore going back to computer programming.<br> That can be very stressful, but it does have the major upside that it can be done at home, indeed with servers and remote access, the computer programming industry was of course one of the leaders being able to employ people in another city, another state, and even another country.<br> I rang a few digital houses in my local area, and one guy I spoke with here in Ballina, Ben, opined that there wasn’t much call for my main programming specialties, but most sites he worked up for clients were six to eight page websites for small businesses, all done in WordPress.<br> So I figured I better learn WordPress.<br> I was reasonably successful (I feel) at this, however almost every time I learned something about that fat, bloated hog of a software package, I became correspondingly increasingly disenchanted with it, and it slowly dawned on me that I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life fiddling about inside the admin panel of WordPress websites, trying to solve the latest problem that was caused by other people’s code.<br> So at around that point I began to give up on the idea of going back to computer programming as a job.<br> And that led, in a roundabout way, to me musing on what I really wanted to do in life, and thus, and thankfully, I recalled that I always wanted to be a writer.<br> So I thought I would start the blog again, and get back in practice.<br> However, as a compromise, I thought I would do the blog on a WordPress free site, and at least keep my hand in with WordPress programming.<br> So I wrote two posts there, but by the time I’d done the second one, I began to notice that there was a formatting bug in the WordPress code.<br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Oa+'" alt="The WordPress formatting bug"><figcaption>The WordPress formatting bug</figcaption></figure> The figure on the left here shows the problem.<br> The paragraphs in green are correctly formatted, while the ones in red show that by this stage I’d already lost patience with it, and just published them as they were.<br> I write these posts in journalistic style, which means every sentence is its own paragraph.<br> So when you hit a full stop, you hit enter, and a new paragraph is automatically started for you.<br> However with WordPress this wasn&#39;t the case, what you had to do was go to the end of the paragraph, hit the space bar, then hit the enter button, and then WordPress would add two lines, instead of the correct only one line.<br> So I hit the delete on the second line, and that just sent the whole thing back to there being no new line at all.<br> So fuming at that, I worked on it and discovered that the solution was even more finicky and blood-pressure raising than I would have believed possible.<br> You had to do all of the above, then cursor down to the start of the new paragraph, then make sure your cursor symbol was hard up against the left margin, then hit delete from there.<br> This solved the problem, but then I realised as mentioned above, I would have to write the whole post, and then go down and make all these finicky and enraging changes for each paragraph.<br> And that’s when I said: ‘fuck this’ and WordPress made the list.<br> So then I decided to go back and check my old blog site, where I can remember never having this enraging problem, and see if I could start using that site again and write stuff without having my blood pressure raised to levels that would make a heart surgeon gibber.<br> However once I got over there, I discovered a new problem that was in its way, even worse.<br> Turns out that you need some sort of privacy policy to explain to your readers what data you are collecting on them, or more enragingly accurately, what data Google and WordPress are collecting from your blog.<br> The moment I read that it immediately occurred to me that since both Blogger and WordPress registered page views, that meant they were collecting some form of data, so with yet another lugubrious sigh I realised I was going to have to do some research and write, or get a privacy policy.<br> Now needless to say, once I began looking into a privacy policy, it quickly became evident, that this was no easy task.<br> There are some free privacy policy generator sites on the web, but when I went there, thinking that should make it easy but discovered that these sites ask a series of questions that I had no idea of the answers to, and so with, once again, my blood pressure rising to nuclear overload levels, I decided that I’m not gonna do that either.<br> Since I didn’t really know what data Google, who now own the Blogspot website, or WordPress were collecting, I couldn’t fill out the questions, since I had no real idea of the answers, and, as ever with these bloody things, most of the info I’d garnered from the web indicated that having a privacy policy that was wrong, or at least incomplete, was as legally problematic as not having one at all, I gave up on the whole idea decided to do my own blog at my GitHub repository.<br> Here I can control what does, and doesn’t, go on the page, and thus has a measure of peace of mind about you, the reader visiting the site.<br> So here is the privacy policy, the blog is now just a simple HTML page that you can read.<br> There are no ‘subscribe’, ‘like’ or comments section, and I certainly am not collecting any data at all.<br> So you can just go on the site, read it, hopefully enjoy it, and then leave.<br> If you wish to comment, you can do so back at Facebook which is the only place I share the new blog site on social media.<br> So there we have it, that&#39;s why WordPress are now on my list. <br> I won&#39;t share the full list with you, because as you would suspect from my eternal complaining, the list is now so long that I need a whole server, not just a single page, to write it fully. </article><article><h2>The only thing worse than</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Ma+'" alt="Wilde"></figure> Also during the week, I ran into some old friends from Byron, Barb and Ivan, we had a good chat, and during that Ivo (I think), came up with a Wildean doublet, that seemed pretty funny at the time <br> The topic was divorce and marriage, and tho I can’t remember how the topic came up, we laughed together over the end summary of it, which was: <br> ‘The only thing worse than getting divorced is getting married in the first place’. <br> So there’s a philosophy for life than we can all muse on. <br> And quick PS: I&#39;m not referring here to my ex-wife, she deserved better than me as a young man, arrogant, uncaring, selfish and entitled young shit that I was. <br> And of course, the final word on Wildean doublets is (almost inevitably) Monty Python. <br> There is a famous sketch where the accepted wits and thinkers of the day are gathered around the king and are engaged in constant flattery of the royal. <br> However the wits get involved in a round of trying to get the others in trouble, and so end up making increasingly derogatory remarks about the king, and so..., well anyway, rather than me try to explain it, you can find that sketch here: <a

bear sat on it</h2><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+$a+'" alt=""></figure> Last post I was writing about the mosquitoes of Canada, how large and ferocious they are, and afterward I was talking with a friend who had also lived in Canada, and he mentioned in passing that apart from the mozzies, outdoor life in Canada is also enlivened, often for short electric periods of enlivenedness (if that&#39;s a word), by bears. <br> Now I won&#39;t presume to discourse on bears, there are plenty of great sources for you to read if the topic of the genus ursus interests you. <br> Probably the best I feel is Bill Bryson&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods_(book)">A Walk in the Woods.</a><br> But my friend&#39;s conversation did remind me, for some reason, of the time I went to borrow a tent from a work colleague. <br> I was living in Vancouver at the time, and was having a sort of long distance relationship with a woman who was living in Los Angeles. <br> We had decided that I would fly into LAX, and then we&#39;d drive in her car up the Pacific Coast Highway to San Francisco, camp in Golden Gate park, and see the sites and the wilderness of the Bay area. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Ha+'" alt=""><figcaption>Golden Gate Park, California</figcaption></figure> My female friend was providing the car, but she said to me: &#39;<i> can you get a tent?</i>&#39; <br> So I asked around at work - I was Greenpeace at the time - and so most people working there were wilderness lovers of one form or another, usually fully accoutred with all sorts of outdoor gear, so I felt that was a reasonable place to start. <br> [Side note: going down to Kmart and spending $20 on a tent just didn&#39;t occur to me, another of my life-long failings has been that I was, perhaps am, a cheapskate beyond belief, but I&#39;m working on getting better.] <br> But leaving my cheapskatedness aside, a work colleague was able to help, she said: &#39;<i> I&#39;ve got a tent you can borrow, it&#39;s a two-person pup tent, you can sleep in it, but one end is really deformed, so you have to make sure you set it up right, so the zipper door is at the end that&#39;s still intact.</i>&#39; <br> So I asked: &#39;<i>Oh, why is it deformed?</i>&#39; <br> To which she replied: &#39;<i>A bear sat on it.</i>&#39; <br> When I thought of that moment again, now, 35 years later, I&#39;m cursing myself for not getting the full story. Good grief, what sort of bloody journalist am I if I&#39;ve been given that sort of lead in, and then didn&#39;t follow up and find out just what on Earth scenario led to someone having a bear sit on their tent, and also were able to live to tell the tale? <br> I can only say that I was a young man in a hurry, like all young people I guess, but as you may also know, I&#39;m very down on myself these days, constantly berating myself for being such a selfish and arrogant young man, uncaring of other people&#39;s feelings and unwilling to listen to anything except the sound of my own voice. <br> And please note, I&#39;m not trying to manipulate anyone&#39;s response here, not looking for: &#39;you weren&#39;t that bad Lock&#39;. <br> Sadly that was genuinely the case, and it&#39;s left me with some large gaping holes in my life as I think back to opportunities for a better life lost because of my selfishness. <br> Anyway, this wasn&#39;t a large hole in the life, but it was certainly something I wished I&#39;d asked more about. <br> So we are thrown back on conjecture, and I am going to guess that what happened was that the owner of the tent was camping somewhere in the wilds of Canada, and at some point a bear came wandering into their camp area, looking for food. <br> The owner of the tent, and those camping nearby, if any, quickly ran as fast as possible to the nearest solid shelter, perhaps a camping hut, a ranger&#39;s station, or possibly their nearby parked cars. <br> Once safe inside a solid enclosure, they were able to watch the bear patrol about, sniffing for food, and at some point the bear found some food, ripped it from its basket or esky, and then sat down at the nearest point to enjoy a leisurely repast. <br> Or, the bear waffled about, found no food, and then sat down to have an enjoyable scratch before heading to the next campground to see if there was any food there. <br> In either scenario, the fact that the bear&#39;s chosen sitting point happened to be already occupied by the south end of my work friend&#39;s tent, I&#39;m sure never crossed the mind of the bear at any point. <br> My work friend&#39;s tent was of this style, two triangle frames at each end. <br><figure class="leftImage"><img src="'+Va+'" alt=""><figcaption>The tent, pre-bear sitting</figcaption></figure><br> Once it had been, er, reshaped by the bear - so my work friend told me - the end had changed to something like this: <br><figure class="rightImage"><img src="'+Wa+'" alt=""><figcaption>The tent deformed</figcaption></figure><br> Anyway, so there you have it, if you do head into the wild&#39;s of Canada and have trouble with bears, hope with all your might that the bear sitting on the end of your tent is the worst of it.

Now that I think about it, I&#39;ll check with him next time I see him, but my therapist Simon is probably the happiest person around at the moment because I&#39;m doing the blog again. <br> Not because what I write uplifts him to a near seraphic, angelic height of good feeling, but because now I&#39;ve got an outlet to whinge constantly to, that is, the internet, it means that I don&#39;t have to do it all in an hour with Simon as a captive audience frantically watching the clock and praying for the incessant torrent of compaining spewing forth from me to stop. <br></article><p></p>',3),La=Ke({__name:"Post_2",setup(e){return(t,o)=>Na}}),qa="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/barts_lawyer_is_here.png",Ga="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/mosquito_statue.png",Ua="/BDA_Vue_Blog/BL_images/Kooteney_NP.png",Ka=k("h2",null,"Bart's lawyer is here",-1),za=k("figure",{class:"rightImage"},[k("img",{src:qa,alt:""})],-1),Ja=k("br",null,null,-1),Ya=k("br",null,null,-1),Xa=k("br",null,null,-1),Qa=k("br",null,null,-1),Za=k("br",null,null,-1),el=k("br",null,null,-1),tl=k("br",null,null,-1),ol=k("br",null,null,-1),nl=k("br",null,null,-1),rl=k("br",null,null,-1),il=k("i",null,"but I can't leave town, my shrink is here'.",-1),sl=k("br",null,null,-1),al=k("br",null,null,-1),ll=k("i",null,"We have roots here, Homer.

"),ul,T(" This involves following an object, in our case a series of lights that bounce back and forth in front of your eyes, and by doing this, it helps the brain let go of old blockages, and form new thought pathways, least I think that's how it works, but like most things to do with the brain, I'm sure even the experts would agree that we humans have only very limited understanding of how things work, or don't work. "),dl,T(" Anyway, EMDR is certainly working for me, but it is best done in house, it can be done remotely on Facetime or Zoom, but that is usually less successful, or rather, perhaps it's best done in a firmly controlled environment like the therapist's office, as it's a such an intense and powerful process, that doing it remotely can be risky. "),fl,T(" For instance if the patient is going thru something really intense, reliving a deeply held trauma from childhood for example, then the internet dropping out at this crucial time can have all sorts of unfortunate ramifications. "),gl,T(" So all of the above meant I really, really didn't want to leave Byron Bay, but such is the life of a poor person. "),ml,T(" Anyway, I have finally found a home on the south bank of the Richmond river at Ballina. "),pl,T(" It's not terrible, but it's not home, and at least I have a short, reasonably comfortable drive to Byron to see Simon and get his excellent help. "),yl,T(" It's very peaceful here, but it's as humid as if every 24.5 litres of atmosphere carries a bucket of water, and the mosquitoes make the cockroaches mentioned above seem like the most concerned and caring of flat mates. "),bl,T(" Now this blog is, and has always been, a forum for me to complain endlessly, however it's also supposed to be passingly humorous, so as my blood pressure and depression dictates, I'll try to wedge some humour into the cracks between me complaining. "),wl,T(" So to that end, let's talk about the mosquitoes again. "),_l,vl,T(" In 1988 and 1989 I lived in Canada, in Vancouver, and I was training for a while with the Simon Fraser University old boys soccer team, on their field high up in the hills in east(ish) Vancouver. "),Il,T(" One night we were training away when at the fringes of hearing, a sort of low-level buzzing began to be discernible. "),kl,T(" I looked out thru the gathering gloom and noticed a sort of second dusk descending upon us, turns out it was a horde of mosquitoes, inbound, and out for blood. "),xl,T(" Very quickly the SFU sports field was alive with players slapping their bare skin frantically to try to stop the onslaught of these airborne vampires. "),Sl,T(" I never seen anything like it in Australia, if you slapped your forearm, your slapping palm and the forearm slapped were just layered in blood. "),Al,T(" And of course, the moment you finished slapping, and removed your hand to wipe off the blood another 100 mosquitoes descended gleefully onto you exposed skin and began the process all over. "),Tl,T(" In the end, training had to be cancelled, there was just no way you could concentrate on the ball or the player you were supposed to be marking, that's if you could even see the player thru the cloud of mozzies. "),Bl,T(" So we ruffty-tuffty jock athletes ran screaming and skin-slapping for the change rooms as the only place of even partial comfort. "),Cl,T(" Some years later I was watching a nature documentary, and it indicated that the caribou of Canada, who go thru one of the longest migrations of any animal on Earth, do so partly to avoid the mosquitoes of the northern lands of Canada. "),jl,T(" When I saw that, and thinking back to that evening on the sports field at SFU, I had absolutely no hesitation in understanding why an animal like the caribou would walk 3,000 kilometres to get away. "),El,T(" The other thing is that Canadian mosquitoes are quite large compared with Australian mosquitoes, the largest genus can be up to 18mm in length (yikes), and this has led to certain swing-the-lead style stories about the mosquitoes of Canada. "),Pl,T(" And the one I remember best was a friend was telling me his uncle had a great story he would tell the kids when they went camping.
