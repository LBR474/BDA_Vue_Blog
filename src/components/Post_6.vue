 <h2>I just have to hope that professional complainer is a real job</h2>

When the disgustingly selfish and disgustingly rich woman who owned my apartment that I eventually got evicted from first decided to put it on the market right in the middle of COVID, 
I was furious for a lot of reasons. <br>
Firstly, there was the completely gobsmacking realisation that this woman had just seen the suffering and death of millions of people across the world as an opportunity to make money. <br>
COVID did a lot of things to the economy, nearly all of them bad, and one of them was the superheating of the housing market, certainly in Byron Bay. <br>
I can’t exactly get it straight in my mind how or why this happened, you would think that with everyone at home because of the lockdowns, no one was selling or buying, so the prices should remain flat. <br>
However like most things to do with economics counter-intuitive seems to be the watchword. <br>
Indeed at this point I always remember something I read somewhere that sums the world of economics perfectly, the original quote is from Laurence J. Peter, and reads: <br>  <code>‘An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.’ </code> <br>
But my recollection was of a slightly different wording, which was slightly clearer in its meaning (I feel): <br> <code>
 ‘economists can’t tell you what will happen tomorrow, but they can tell you why they were wrong yesterday’. </code> <br>
Anyway, if interested in why the housing market super-balloooned in price in many places across Australia, you can find various sources on your favourite search engine to explain this better than me. <br>

The upshot of this appalling, gobsmacking levels of cynicism from the cow who held my accommodation destiny in her hands was that one way or another, I had to start frantically exploring options for somewhere else to live. <br>
As mentioned previously, I quickly discerned from looking at RealEstate.com and other sites that I couldn't afford anywhere in my home town of Byron Bay, not by a long chalk, so I began to explore the idea of getting some work, preferably at a higher pay rate, so that when the end came, I was at least an outside chance of finding somewhere to live that didn’t involve a daily contest with the cockroaches and rats to decide who really owned the place. <br>
I’ve had four main careers in my life: teacher, journalist, computer programmer and gardener. <br>
And with the axe poised over my lovely life in Byron Bay, I figured my best chance of work that would allow me to pay for a flat in Byron Bay would be computer programming.
When I first worked in IT in Sydney in the 90s I was a web designer, and became most adept at a language called javascript. <br>
So with the immediate need to earn some bucks, I opened up my memory banks and began doing a bit of programming to see if I was up to the challenge of getting a job in this industry again. <br>
I made up a few pages using HTML and JavaScript and as I did, I began to notice that the JavaScript I was studying was being constantly referred to as "vanilla JavaScript". <br>
I didn’t think too much about that, until the day came when I rang a recruitment consultant in Brisbane to discover what my chances of getting programming work were.
The result of that phone call was that my chances were zero, probably less than zero given the other invisible factors that stalked that conversation, more on that later. <br>
<p></p>

And just to break out of that for a second, with my chances of higher paying computer work being accurately described as: ‘lucky to be zero’, that reminded me a couple of amusing lines aligned with this from the world of sport. <br>

One was ABC rugby league commentator Warren Ryan saying one day - of a team that had performed abysmally: <code> ‘they were lucky to get nil’.</code> <br>
<p></p>
And Billy Connolly on soccer in Glasgow. <br>
To set the scene, in Glasgow, as I’m sure you all probably know, soccer is king, it’s an obsession with the local inhabitants that goes beyond mental illness really. <br>
There are two major teams Glasgow Rangers (protestant) and Glasgow Celtic (catholic). <br>
Almost all attention is focussed on these two teams, not just in Glasgow, but across Scotland as a whole. <br>
Thus the third Glasgow team, Partick Thistle, rarely raises the attention needle above 0.1 when people gathered in pubs are talking Scottish soccer. <br>
Partick Thistle are often not even in the top division, and are famous for losing more matches than they win, so Billy Connolly once gagged: <code> ‘I’d just like to point out that the team’s name is Partick Thistle F.C, not Partick Thistle NIL’.</code> <br>

So back to my search for work, as I spoke with the recruitment consultant and told her what I’d been studying, she opined that I would be lucky to get any work in my current state of readiness, I would have to learn what was called the JavaScript frameworks. <br>
So after a few more words of conversation, the tone of which from her end was: I hope I never hear from you again, I only want to hear from highly experienced programmers who will work for low pay so I get my commission and don’t care about the rest, I rang off and  went onto the ‘net to find out what these framework things were. <br>
Even if you haven’t worked in computers, probably your experience with your mobile phone has already given you an understanding that software development is rapid to the point of lightning pace. <br>
Almost everytime you go to the mobile phone repair store, they tell you some part, or all, of your phone is now outdated and is no longer supported, so you’ve got to buy a new phone. <br>
Well software for web pages and ‘net development is exactly the same. <br>
I had last worked in computers in about 2001, and now it was 2022, and so 22 years of breakneck speed changes to the JavaScript language meant that I effectively had to start all over again. <br>
The JavaScript frameworks, at the time I began looking, were headed by three main brands, Angular (Google), React (hosted by Facebook) and Vue, written by a genius who used to work at Google. <br>
To say they were different from vanilla JavaScript is like saying that black is different from white. <br>
As I looked at it I realised that when it came to JavaScript, I spoke latin and the rest of the (employed) world spoke modern italian. <br>
Just to outline it briefly, in the old days when I was doing javascript programming, things were at a leisurely pace in the work place - or maybe I was just a slack and lazy employee - you simply typed in your code, refreshed the page and saw if your code had worked. <br> 
However the modern frameworks are highly autoated, and are automatically compiled by the transpiler every time you make some changes to your code. <br>
This is generally convenient, but brings - to me anyway - an added feeling of pressure with the code trnaspiler running at all times. <br> 
<figure class="rightImage">
 <img src="/pro_complain_images/transpiler_update.png" alt="">
 <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

This is quite a good thing mostly, but for me as a learner, it was quite anxiety provoking as it meant that you now had to not only learn the language of javascript, which was like learning a foreign language, something many of us enjoy, but also you had to learn a whole lot of new stuff about package.json files, vite.config options and a host of complicated and terrifying things in the deeper recesses of your computer. <br>
Added to which, JavaScript itself had an added layer to it in the modern era, called TypeScript. <br>
THis is an inherently good idea, typescript is like an editor that looks at your code pre-run time, and tells you if there are any problems with your code, that are going to surface and cause bigger problems when the code runs live on the ‘net. <br>
However as a raw, green beginner with typescript, I found the error messages hopelessly confusing.
<figure class="leftImage">
 <img src="/pro_complain_images/showPost_index_error.png" alt="">
 <figcaption>To give you a brief idea of the issues that can arise, this property error had to be solved by changing the code on a completely different page, something took me a long frustrating time to figure out.</figcaption>
</figure>

Whenever these terrifying red lines appeared on my code page, I would groan internally as I knew it meant some hours, possibly days of research across the internet trying to find a solution to these problems. <br>

Anyway, I continued with my studies and became I feel reasonably adept at the modern frameworks, typescript, package.json and all the rest. <br>
My schedule was to do a project in Angular, one in React and one in Vue, then - as it turns out, in my hopeless naivete - I felt I would be ready to apply for jobs in the programming world. <br>
So I began my study with Angular and produced a learning game for those doing Taekwondo.
It went pretty well, but there were a few enraging moments. <br>
And I would just like to ask some of you reading this, Michael and Stokesy particularly, to bare with me while I tell this story again. <br> 
You two have both heard this a couple of times in our phone calls, and so sorry you’ve now got to revisit it in written form. <br>
The Angular JavaScript framework has a kind of formatting template that you can use called Angular Material. <br>
I took a look at it, and liked how it looked, and so I decided to use it in my project, the taekwondo learning game. <br>
So I went to the Angular Material tutorial website, and followed their instructions to install it. <br>
I then tried to get it to run, but I began to get the console lit up in red like it was on fire, indicating that there was a bug(s) in my code. <br>
<figure class="rightImage">
 <img src="/pro_complain_images/console_red.png" alt="">
 <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
So I went back to the tutorial website, checked that I had followed the instructions correctly, and I had, but still my console looked like it had measles, with a  rash of angry red crosses all over the readout telling me something was vastly wrong. <br>
So then I began to widen my search onto the internet, particularly to the programmers forum, Stack Overflow, to try to find out what was wrong. <br> 
This went on for nearly three days, while I grew increasingly angry and frustrated, my hair began to pile up around me on the floor as I pulled huge chunks of it out, trying to get to the bottom of this error(s). <br> 
Anyway, more by chance than good technique on my part, I was reading a post on Stack Overflow that was sort of related to my problem and right at the bottom, someone had mentioned, almost as a throwaway line, that the poster of that problem, should check their version, because that can cause problems in Angular. <br>
I didn’t think that could help me, but I was truly grasping at straws now, so I decided I had better at least do that. <br> 
Well it did solve the problem, but it did nothing for my blood pressure, and annoyance at Angular/Google for putting me through that. <br>
It turns out that the command Google had told me to use on their tutorial website was out of date, and the numbers on my version list were way too low for me to be able to use Angular Material. <br>
Moving on then with hope in my heart, I created a new project, installed manually a version level of Angular Material that the node package manager could work with, and the problem was solved. <br>
However I was still f***ing fuming about that some weeks later when I completed my project. <br>
Having done what set out to do with Angular it was time to work on a React project, which I did, and then began a Vue project and completed that. (This blog site is made with Vue by the way). <br>
In neither React nor Vue did I have anywhere near the levels of hair-tearing and fuming that Angular gave me, so before it was time to come around in the cycle back to Angular again, I checked the ‘net for usage figures on the three frameworks. <br>
Turns out Angular was way down now at only 22% of developers using it, with React the most popular (at that time) and Vue coming along behind React towards the top of the pile. <br>
That was enough for me, I decided to never willingly use Angular again. <br>
A lesson for bloody Google, if you want to retain your popularity with developers, update your f**ing tutorial website. <br>
As a raw beginning learner, I’ve got enough problems without you putting the wrong commands on the damn ‘how-to’ website. <br>
So with my three projects in the main frameworks complete, I now felt I was ready to at least begin applying for jobs, but immediately a host new problems began to surface and overwhelm my intent. <br>
And at this point I was reminded of another time I faced head-beating-against-the-wall confounding paradoxes like this. <br>
In the 90s I was working in computers in the corporate world of Sydney and already starting to understand that I didn’t want to do this for the rest of my life, so I reactivated my always just-beneath-the-surface desire to be a writer. <br>
Back then you could still make a living as a writer, even become rich if you were prepared to write soft porn, or hopelessly commercial novels with a lot of sex on them.
I wasn’t prepared to do that, but was taken with the idea of seeing my name on the spine of a book in the local book store, so I wrote my first book: How Not to Build a Mud Brick House. <br>
It was, like all first draft of first novels by anyone I guess, really, really bad. <br>
It described me buying some land outside Byron Bay and building a mud brick house on it, then leaving the corporate world of Sydney and going up there and doing nothing for the rest of my life except surfing, growing organic veggies in my garden and spending the rest of my time staring out the window at the view. <br>
So much I didn’t understand, mostly just how much money you needed to buy anything in Byron Bay, even back then. <br>
If you were lucky you could afford a dog kennel, to buy a house, flat or even some land, you had to enslave yourself to a mortgage and then spend the rest of your career stuck in Sydney writing JavaScript code till you expired of a heart attack and never got the chance to live on your land and stare out the window, thanks a f***Ing lot big four banks of Australia. <br>
Anyway, leaving that aside, and returning to the initial paradox of life as a writer, I worked away at my novel and eventually finished it, and in my hopeless delusion, thought: ‘ok, that’s the hard part done, now to contact some publishers’. <br>
So I printed out some copies, and got them bound by the print shop at Compaq computers, where I was working at the time, then one lunchtime I took five copies of my book down to the post office and sent it to five publishers. <br>
Then I waited. <br>
I hesitate to write ‘in my hopeless naivete’ more than fifty times per post, but even as I recollect that time, nothing else really sums up my perpetually deluded state of mind that I had as an arrogant and foolish younger man. <br>
Moving on, after some weeks of waiting, I began to feel that I should have heard from at least one, if not all of the publishers I had sent to, expecting (in my hopeless naivete) that they would have read it by now and were, now in the process of contacting me to tell me they would be publishing my book and by the end of the year would have sold some thousands of copies and I would soon be if not rich, at least comfortably living on the background income of book royalties pouring in. <br>
But with no word, I felt I better get proactive, so I rang one of the publishers.
There I spoke with a helpful person, and even that was something of a miracle, as that conversation made me realise. <br>
I say miracle, because publishers are so swamped that even getting someone to answer the phone is a something of a rarity, compare with the modern era where no company answers the phone but simply advises you in the voice answer message to go to their website and look at the Frequently Asked Questions page and see if that helps with your query, meaning: f*** off and don’t bother us. <br>
Anyway the helpful person at the publishers told me that they don’t take unsolicited manuscripts, <code>‘we only publish books sent to us by literary agents’. </code> 
So I rang off and went to the yellow pages for Sydney and looked up literary agents, and there were three listed as I recall.I rang the first one in the book and they told me: <code>‘we won’t take you on unless you’ve already been published’. </code> <br>
So with a snarling groan at the unfairness of life (as I saw it), my literary ambitions died for the moment. <br>
There was back then a thing called vanity publishing, where you publish your own book, and then hawk it around book stores hoping they would put it on the shelf, but I was not really prepared to do that. <br> 
There have been successes using this process, Mathew Reilly, the thriller writer, began this way, and I suppose I could have done that, but as I look back on it, that just all seemed too hard. <br> 

<figure class="rightImage">
 <img src="/pro_complain_images/mathew_reilly.png" alt="">
 <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
I think I felt hard done by in a way, feeling, as mentioned above, that I had already done the hard part by writing and completing the book, so felt (in my hopeless naivete) that it wasn’t fair that I now had to begin an even harder part by self-publishing and walking around Sydney trying to convince book store owners to put my book on the shelf. <br>
Anyway, leaving the past where it was, there were bigger factors at play ruling the world of publishers and literary agents, and that was the end of publishing on paper itself. <br>
Coming forwards to the modern era, I wrote my second book, Long Way Round to Rehab and published it on the internet at SmashWords. <br>
So in its way I am a published author, and with a third book in my mind now, I can happily bypass the whole agent-publisher quagmire and do it whenever I like.
And just to close this post down, I like being a gardener, I really do, but the big down side is the driving. <br>
In most working weeks I drive 300-400 kilometres, and I really hate that. <br> 
It’s not a sustainable life, all those fossil fuel fumes I burn getting to my gardening clients houses  seem to make a mockery of styling myself as a sustainable maintenance gardener. <br>
It - almost as ever - increases my fury at the woman who kicked me into the street, and the banks and conservative governments who caused this crippling financial pressure on lower and middle-income Australians. <br>
To explain that, when I realised that I needed to get some more work, my first and best option was to rebuild my gardening business back up, so I did what I had done before, and put an ad in the Byron Shire Echo. <br> 
I was living not even in Ballina at the time, but worse than that, 30 k south of Ballina in a dead or alive town called Broadwater, and once again in my hopeless delusion, I honestly thought by the time build the gardening round back up to full speed, I will be living back in Byron shire, so the driving will be vastly reduced. <br>
How wrong I was. <br>
I am at least in Ballina now, and I do like it generally, but there is still a sixty k plus round trip to go work each working day, and that has rapidly become very waring.
This of course adds to the problem of making enough money to move home, which is that all that driving cuts down on the profit for each hour’s work. <br>
So, gardening is ok, but now certainly with winter coming on and less gardening work needing to be done, it was/is time to explore computer work again. <br>
Computer work - even if I’m working for an employer in Brisbane or the gold coast - can be done from my desk here in Ballina, and it means I can get up at six a.m, make a coffee, and be at work at 6.05. <br>
However my long absence from the industry, and that fact - that I now suspect - is that no one will employ a sixty year old man to do the sort of code that is cutting edge and groovy, they only really want to employ 23-year-olds fresh out of college. <br>
In computer programming, and perhaps in all industries, there's an innate, and possibly barely seen or realised prejudice against older employees, in fact that's probably the case for society as a whole. <br>
However I’ll keep exploring it, and with my new found confidence thanks to my therapist Simon, and supportive friends, I feel that I’ll eventually land something, and can reduce my driving to under 100 kilometres a week, or even better, move back to my home in Byron Bay, and work from my computer on my desk and recude my daily commute to work from 60-80 k down to two metres, the distance from the kitchen to the living room. <br>
If that doesn’t work out as a computer programmer, or as a gardener, and it already hasn’t as a journalist or as a teacher, then I’m sure I can continue to build my career as a professional complainer, here on the blog. <br>
As you can all see already, complaining as a career for me is absolutely going very successfully so far. <br>
See you next week everybody. <br>
