    <h2>A bear sat on it</h2>

      Last post I was writing about the mosquitoes of Canada, how large and
      ferocious they are, and afterward I was talking with a friend who had also
      lived in Canada, and he mentioned in passing that apart from the mozzies,
      outdoor life in Canada is also enlivened, often for short electric periods
      of enlivenedness (if that's a word), by bears. <br />

      Now I won't presume to discourse on bears, there are plenty of great
      sources for you to read if the topic of the genus ursus interests you.
      <br />
      Probably the best I feel is Bill Bryson's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Walk_in_the_Woods_(book)"
        >A Walk in the Woods.</a
      >
      <br />

      But my friend's conversation did remind me, for some reason, of the time I
      went to borrow a tent from a work colleague. <br />

      I was living in Vancouver at the time, and was having a sort of long
      distance relationship with a woman who was living in Los Angeles. <br />

      We had decided that I would fly into LAX, and then we'd drive in her car
      up the Pacific Coast Highway to San Francisco, camp in Golden Gate park,
      and see the sites and the wilderness of the Bay area. <br />

      My female friend was providing the car, but she said to me: '<i>
        can you get a tent?</i
      >' <br />
      So I asked around at work - I was Greenpeace at the time - and so most
      people working there were wilderness lovers of one form or another,
      usually fully accoutred with all sorts of outdoor gear, so I felt that was
      a reasonable place to start. <br />

      [Side note: going down to Kmart and spending $20 on a tent just didn't
      occur to me, another of my life-long failings has been that I was, perhaps
      am, a cheapskate beyond belief, but I'm working on getting better.] <br />

      But leaving my cheapskatedness aside, a work colleague was able to help,
      she said: '<i>
        I've got a tent you can borrow, it's a two-person pup tent, you can
        sleep in it, but one end is really deformed, so you have to make sure
        you set it up right, so the zipper door is at the end that's still
        intact.</i
      >' <br />
      So I asked: '<i>Oh, why is it deformed?</i>' <br />

      To which she replied: '<i>A bear sat on it.</i>' <br />

      When I thought of that moment again, now, 35 years later, I'm cursing
      myself for not getting the full story. Good grief, what sort of bloody
      journalist am I if I've been given that sort of lead in, and then didn't
      follow up and find out just what on Earth scenario led to someone having a
      bear sit on their tent, and also were able to live to tell the tale?
      <br />

      I can only say that I was a young man in a hurry, like all young people I
      guess, but as you may also know, I'm very down on myself these days,
      constantly berating myself for being such a selfish and arrogant young
      man, uncaring of other people's feelings and unwilling to listen to
      anything except the sound of my own voice. <br />

      And please note, I'm not trying to manipulate anyone's response here, not
      looking for: 'you weren't that bad Lock'. <br />
      Sadly that was genuinely the case, and it's left me with some large gaping
      holes in my life as I think back to opportunities for a better life lost
      because of my selfishness. <br />

      Anyway, this wasn't a large hole in the life, but it was certainly
      something I wished I'd asked more about. <br />

      So we are thrown back on conjecture, and I am going to guess that what
      happened was that the owner of the tent was camping somewhere in the wilds
      of Canada, and at some point a bear came wandering into their camp area,
      looking for food. <br />

      The owner of the tent, and those camping nearby, if any, quickly ran as
      fast as possible to the nearest solid shelter, perhaps a camping hut, a
      ranger's station, or possibly their nearby parked cars. <br />

      Once safe inside a solid enclosure, they were able to watch the bear
      patrol about, sniffing for food, and at some point the bear found some
      food, ripped it from its basket or esky, and then sat down at the nearest
      point to enjoy a leisurely repast. <br />

      Or, the bear waffled about, found no food, and then sat down to have an
      enjoyable scratch before heading to the next campground to see if there
      was any food there. <br />

      In either scenario, the fact that the bear's chosen sitting point happened
      to be already occupied by the south end of my work friend's tent, I'm sure
      never crossed the mind of the bear at any point. <br />

      My work friend's tent was of this style, two triangle frames at each end.
      <br />

      </figure>
      <br />

      Once it had been, er, reshaped by the bear - so my work friend told me -
      the end had changed to something like this: <br />
      <figure class="rightImage">
        <img src="/BS_images/tent_deformed.png" alt="" />

      </figure>
      <br />

      Anyway, so there you have it, if you do head into the wild's of Canada and
      have trouble with bears, hope with all your might that the bear sitting on
      the end of your tent is the worst of it. [And that you're not in the tent
      if that happens]

      <h3>My love/hate relationship with the Burns Point ferry</h3>
      <figure class="rightImage">
        <img src="/BS_images/Charles_darwin.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
     

      I was reading once that Charles Darwin, of course best known for Origin of
      the Species and the theory of evolution, also did an exhaustive study of
      barnacles. <br />
      It took him nine years and at the end he wrote in his journal:
      

      I mention that because my new home is on the south side of the river at
      Ballina, and while I like it well enough, it comes with a slight
      inconvenience if you wish to drive into the shops at Ballina, that you
      have to take the ferry across the river at Burns Point. <br />

      On bike riding days, I positively love coming over the river on the ferry.
      <br />

      However on work days, in my car of course, and in a hurry to get to my
      garden client's place, the waiting around for the ferry has already begun
      to grate on me. <br />

      I've been in South Ballina two months, and during the week, with a big job
      to be done up at Coorabell, I got the worst scenario, arriving at the
      southern ferry dock and seeing the ferry having just departed. <br />

      This meant a ten to fifteen minute wait while the ferry went across,
      disgorged its cars and trucks, then reloaded, and came back for me and the
      other cars waiting in the line. <br />

      And as I sat there this day, it occurred to me that tho I've only been
      living in South Ballina for two months, I've come to hate waiting for the
      Burns Point ferry as much as Charles Darwin hated barnacles. <br />

      And I can already hear some of you saying: '<i>
        Lock, if the biggest thing you've got to complain about is waiting on
        the banks of a beautiful river to take a short smooth boat ride, then
        you've got problems.</i
      >' <br />

      To which I reply I know that, I do indeed have big problems, that's why I
      see a clinical psychologist once a month, and additionally, the whole
      point of this blog is for me to complain, so there's that as well. Now
      that I think about it, I'll check with him next time I see him, but my
      therapist Simon is probably the happiest person around at the moment
      because I'm doing the blog again. <br />
      Not because what I write uplifts him to a near seraphic, angelic height of
      good feeling, but because now I've got an outlet to whinge constantly to,
      that is, the internet, it means that I don't have to do it all in an hour
      with Simon as a captive audience frantically watching the clock and
      praying for the incessant torrent of compaining spewing forth from me to
      stop. <br />
